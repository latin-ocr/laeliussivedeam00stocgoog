c. Rupilio. Cp. 55 37. 73, 101. P. Rupilius was a friend and con·
temporary of Scipio and Laelius. His elevation to the consulship (Β. e.
¹3²) was a striking instance of change of fortune. For his poverty had
previously compelled him to accept the control of the customs in Sicily,
and now he was sent to the same province, as consul, to put an end to
the Servile War (Val. Max. VI, 9, 5 8). Such was the strictness of his
discipline that he ordered his own son-inlaw, Q. Fabius, to quit the
province, for having through his negligence lost the citadel of Tauro·
menium (Ibid. 11, 7, 5 3). He was brought to trial after his consulship
for his harsh treatment of the friends and followers of Tiberius (Vel.
Pat. II, 7, 5 4). There is a curious statement by the historian Fannius
(Tnsc. IV, 5 40) that he died through excessive grief at his brother's re·
jection for the consulship (cp. 5 7 ).

d. Mummio. Spurius Mummius (cp. 5 101) was brother of the
famous L Mummius Achaicus, who destroyed Corinth and formed the
Roman province of Achaia in the sarne year in which Scipio took Car·
thage (B.C.146). Spurius seems to have been a man of more culture
thanhis brother. Cicero introduces him also into the De Republica,
where he is spoken of as a special favonrite of Scipio's (I, 5 18). He
bad been with him shortly before in Rhodes (111, 5 48), His politics
may be jndged of from the following trenchant sentence-‘ Sed tamen
vel regnum malo quam liberum populum' (III, 5 46). Asanatural
consequence he hated rhetoricians (V, 5 11). He wrote some humorons
epistles in verse to his friends from Corinth, where Cicero surmises that
he may bave acted as ‘legatus' to his brother (Ad Att. XIII, 6, 5 4 3
30. t st· '

ι. inferioris ordinis, ‘friends of lower rank,’ in contrast with those
just mentioned, who held the chief place in his affections.

f. Quintum. . . Maximum. Q. Fabius Maximus Aemilianus was
the eldest son of Paulus Macedonium, and so brother to Africanus Minor
(see 5 9 fi). When their father died, Africanus gave up to Fabius his
own share of the inheritanee (Paradox. 5 48). He served under his ,
father in the last war against Macedonia, iac. 168 (LivaLlV, 35 ; App.
Hisp. 65). In nc. 145 he was made consul himself (cp. 5 96), and
conducted the war against Viriathus in Spain, bnt without much success.
Afterwards he commanded one of the two cumps by which Numantia
was invested in tbe year (hc. 133) in which bis brother Scipio took that
city (App. Hisp. 90).

g. omnino. This word has here a concessive force—‘an excellent
man, ladmit!

bulking more largely in the eyes of the world. Scipio was animated
