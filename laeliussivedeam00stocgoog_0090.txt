Μ. TULLII CICERONIS

clauses indicates that one action will be completed at the same time as
the other.

c. quemadmodumsoles. See§ 5 f.

d. disputaris, ‘discuss and tell!

c. quid sentias, &c We have here a brief instance of what is
known in rhetoric as‘divisio' or‘partitio.' ‘Quid sentias’carries usas far
as the end of 5 24, where the words ‘Hactenus mihi videor de amicitia
quid sentirem, potuisse dicere,’ mark the close of the first head. qualem
existumas extends from the beginning of 5 ι6 to the end os 5 35. The
third head quae praecepta des occupies the rest of the dialogue its be·
ginning being marked by the words ‘Quamobrem id primum videamus’ in
5 36. Three heads are declared by Cornificius (Ad Herennium 1, 5 17)
to be the proper number for a speech. But of course the number must
vary with the requirements of the subject matter even in ioreusic oratory,
and this is still more the case in a philosophical disquisition. In the
De Natura Deorum the Stoic views on theology are distributed by
Balbus under four heads See ΙΙ, §3 and 111, 5 6-‘quadripertita’
iuquit ‘fuit divisio tua, primum ut velles docere deos esse, deinde quales
essent, tum ab iis mundum regi, postremo consulere eos rebus humanis.
haec, sirecte memini, partitio fuit!

s. tecum agere, ‘make that request of you) Cp. 5 4a.

g antevortit. Archaicformfor‘ antevertit’

§12 a. gravarer. ‘Gravari’' 1s to make objections, tu representathmgas
difficult. Cp. Caesar, B. G. 1, 35—‘ hanc sibi populoque Romano gratiam
referret, utin colloquium venire invitatus gravaretur)

b. consuetudo . . . ut. 5 ι4Ιι.

c. censeo petatis. §5c.

d. qui ista profitentur. There isa trace here of the aristocratic
scorn of the professions. Laelius is a Roman gentleman, not u sophist.
The feeling was not confined to the Romans. The young Hippocrates,
iu the Protagoras, though so eager about philosophy, rs seen to blush ru
the morning light at the idea of his wishing to take to the profession
(Prot. 312A).

evei secundas vel adversas, ‘to prosperity or adversity, take
which you will’ The alternatives though exclusive, are not exhaustive
—adversity or prosperity or both.

518. a. nisi in bonis amicitiam esse non posse Cp. Plato,
Lysis 214 D-o‘· ἀγαθὸς τῳ ἀγαθῷ μόνοι μόνῳ planari δὲ κακὸς οὔτ’
ἀγαθῷ οὔτε κακῷ οὐδέποτε eis ἀληθῆ φιλίαν ἔρχεται. This conclusion is
deduued from the physical principle that like seeks like. Socrates is
made to argue that the vicked are never continuously like themselves,
but crazy and unstable (ἀλλ’ ἐμπλήκτους τε aul ἀσταθμήτους. Cp. Isaiah,
lvii. 20-¹But the wicked are like the troubled sea3 for it cannot rest,
