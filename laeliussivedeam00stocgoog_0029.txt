THE SCIPIONIC CIRCLE. 25

oldinary mortals. This leads on to remarks about Socrates’

rejection of natural science, though he is so abtruse and Pytha-
gorean in Plato. At this point L. Furius Philus drops in,
accompanied by a young man P. Rutilius Rufus, who, like
Lucilius, had served under Africanus at Numantia. Furius had
studied astronomy, and is appealed to as an authority. But
before he can deliver himself on the subject a page enters the
room to say that Laelius is coming. Scipio hereupon puts on
his boots and coat‚ and goes out into the portico to meet him.
He is accompanied by his two sons-in-law C. Fannius and
Q. Scaevola, and by Spurius Mummius, a very dear friend of
Scipio’s, in spite of his disagreement in his censorship with his
brother Lucius, the conqueror of Corinth. They take a few
tums in the portico, Laelius occupying the place of honour in
the middle, and are just about to adjoum to a pleasant spot in
a meadoW, where'they might catch the winter sun, when yet
another friend of all present comes in. This is the great lawyer
M. Manilius, whom Laelius, the wag of the party, rallies with
some remarks about legal proceedings between the two suns,
Laelius holds the Socratic position that they had better attend
to things at home, and let things in the heavens look after
themselves: but Furius answers from the Stoic standpoint that
the world is their home ¹, and that what happens therein must
necessarily concern them. So Furius is allowed his chance of
speaking, and begins with C. Sulpicius Gallus, a most learned
man and great student of astronomy in the same generation
as their fathers. Gallus has much to say about a sphere made
by Archimedes the mechanism of which could be worked so as
to display the motions of the heavenly bodies. The conversation
gets more and more sublime until Laelius again insists on
bringing it down to human interests, and leaving the two suns to
fight it out between themselves. He calls upon Africanus for a
discourse upon political philosophy, seeing that he is not only
the leading statesman of Rome, but has often discussed the
subject along with those learned Greeks Polybius and Panaetius.
Africanus is compelled to admit that he has studied the subject,
