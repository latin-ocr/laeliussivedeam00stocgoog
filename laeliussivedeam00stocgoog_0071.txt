a. Q. Munius sumar. Q. Mucius Scaevola the augur is to be§l.
l distinguished from his more illustrious namesake, who was known
; as ‘pontifex’ He was no great emtor, but was a man of shrewd
ζ intelleet and skilled in civil law. This Q. Mucius Scaevola was
. consul in rac. 117, twelve years aster the date at which this dialogue is
¹ supposed to have taken place. He was still alive during the Marsic or
Social War (nc. 90-88)‚ and in spite of old age and seeble health
. displayed a conspicuous example of energy. No client ever sound him
; in bed in the morning, and he used to be the first to enter the senate
“ (Phil. VIlI, 5 31). After the close os this warin nc. 88, when Sulla
had accomplished his victorious march on Rome, Mucius refused to
join in the decree oi proscription against Marius, declaring that he
would not, sor the sake os the few poor drops of blood that remained to
him, declare him a public enemy by whom the City aud Italy had been
flayed. This conduct os hisis cited by Valerius Maximus (ΙΙΙ, 8, 5 5)
as a shining instance os the Roman virtue of ‘ constantia)

Mucius the augur is a favourite ‘persona' with Cicero, who intro-
duces him not only here, but also in the De Oratore and the De
Republica.
