M. TULLII CICERONIS

made his knowledge useful by predicting to the soldiers that an eclipse
of the moon would take plaoe the following night, telling thern the'
exact time it would last and ascribiug its cause to the intervention of
the earth'sshadow (Livy XLIV, 37; Plin. N. H. 11, 12 or 5 53). In this
way the Romana were saved from the scare which pervaded the Macedo·
nian camp. It should be added that according to Cicero (De Rep. 1, 5
23) the prophecy was after the event. Two years later he became consul
himself (ac. 166) along with M. Claudius Marcellus, grandson of the
capturer of Syracuse, aud carried on a successful campaign against the
Ligurians (Liv. XLV, 443 Epit. XLVI). It wasia his consulship that the
Andria of Terence was acted, as appears from the Didascalia prefixed
to that play. Ihave not thought it necessary to follow Baiter in the
spelling Galus in this passage. The name isspelt Gallus by Kayser in ·
vol. Il, Brut. 5 78, and by Baiter himself in vol. VIII, De Rep. 5 21.

k. in perfecto et sasamon viro. M. Porcius Cato Licinianus, the
eldest sou of Cato the Censor, was eminent as a jurist. Aulus Gellius
(x111, ιο) says—‘ egregios de juris disciplina libros reliquit' and he is
referred to as an authority in the Digest (Ι, ii, a, 5 38). He fought at
Pydna under Aemilius Paulus, whose daughter he afterwards married.
There is an anecdote related of the coolness with which he recovered
his sword in battle, when he had dropped it (Val. Max. III, a, 5 16).
He was ‘praetor designatus' when he died. The modesty of his
funeral, suitable to his father's narrow means, is remarked upon in Liv.
Epit. 48. Cp. the reference to him in the Cato Maior, 5 68⁴ Sensi
ego in optimo filio . . . mortem omni aetati esse commune!

ξ 10. a. oave . . . anteponas. ‘Cave' it may be noticed, is the only word
in Latin after which ‘ne ’ can be omitted.

anulus enim facta, &c This is said from an ex parte stand·
point. For the life of Socrates influenced his followers no less thau his
discourses. ‘Huius' is used of Cato, as being nearer from a Roman
point of view.

c. habetote. The so-called future imperative is used in laws and
in solemn and definite exhortations. Cp. Cat. Mai. 5 79-‘ eundem igitur
esse creditate, etiam si nullum videbitis': ‘you must beliere therefore
that l exist all the same, even though you shall see me not at all!

d. desiderio. ‘Desiderium' is here used in its strict sense of regret

for what is dear and lost. Cp. 5 104 and Hor. Cann. Ι, ²4· 5 1-

tam cori capitisl’

e. moveri. ‘Motus' ‘affectus’ ‘perturbationes’ ‘commotiones animi*
are all used as equivalents for the Greek πάθη, to describe those gasts of
passion which are liable to disturb the calm reasonableness of the sege.
Of these terms ‘motus’ is the mildest. Cp. T. D. 111, 5 7-‘Nam
