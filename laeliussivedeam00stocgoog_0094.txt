M. TULLII CICERONIS

better definition-‘voluntas erga aliquem rerum bonarum illius ipsius
causa, quern diligit, cum eius pari voluntate) The only flaw that can
be found in this statement is that the disinterested good will might exist
on both sides, and yet be conoealed by a reciprocat ignorance. Cp.
Arist. Ε. N. VIII, 2, 1 4-φίλονς δὲ πῶς ἄν τις εἴποι λανθάνοντας ὡς
ἔχουσιν {euroin δεῖ ripa εὐνοεῖν ἀλλήλοις veui βούλεσθαι τάγαθὰ μὴ
λανθάνοντας.

e. omnium rerum consensio, ‘agreement on all things
sacred aud secular.’ An objective genitive like this is more common
when the verb from which the abstract noun Is formed govems the ac-
cusative, as iu the passage just quoted, where ‘voluntas rerum bonarnm'
suggests ‘ velle res bonas!

fhaud soio an . . ,nihi1‚‘1 doubt whether anything! ‘Haud
scio an,' ‘ nescio an' iudicate a suspicion that athing is: hence a doubt
is expressed by the addition ofa negative.

g. excepta sapientia. ‘Sapientia’ may be taken to include ‘virtus’
Α Cp. the last words 01 the dialogue. Ι

Ιι. 111111 melius. Cp. E. N. IX, 9,§ 1, where frieudship is declared
to be the greatest of extemal goods (ὃ δοκεῖ τῶν ἐκτὸς ἀγαθῶν μέγιστον
εἶναι). In IV, 3, § 10 this primacy was assigned to honour (μέγιστον
γὰρ δὴ τοῦτο τῶν ἐκτὸς ἀηιιθῶν). They cannot both be the greatest.
But in VIII, 8, § 2 we have the question definitely settled iu favour of
friendship. Hononr is there shown not to be an end in itself. Itis
sought from the powerful as a pledge 01 prosperity, from the wise and
good as a proof 01 merit, whereas meu delight iu being loved in and for
itself (τῷ φιλεῖσθαι δὲ καθ’ αὐτὸ χαίρουσι. διὸ δόξειεν κρεῖττον εῖναι τοῦ
τιμᾶσθαι).

i. a dis inmortalibus. Both here aud iu 5 104 the attitude 01
Laelius is more reverent than that 01 ancient philosophy generally.
Wisdom and virtue were just the things which the sage was supposed to
provide for himself. In the De Natura Deorum (III, 1 86) Cotta is
made to say—‘atque hoc quidem omnes mortales sic habent, externas
commoditates. ..a dis se habere; virtutem autem nemo unquam ac·
ceptam deo retulit! See the whole passage ending-‘ iudicium hoc
omnium mortalium est, fortunam a deo petendam, a se ipso sumendam
esse sapientiam! Cp. Hor. Epist. I, 18, 111-

‘sed satis est orare Iovem, qui ponit et aufert,
detritam, det opes; aequum mi animum ipse parabo!
So Juvenal (X, 356-63), after enumerating the things that are really
worth praying for, adds—
.‘ monstro quod ipse tibi possis darc?
The claims to genuineness of the ¹ Consolatio ' might almost be disposed
of 01 the strength of this one passage (ξ 184), so contrary to the 1011-
