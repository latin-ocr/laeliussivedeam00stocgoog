CICERO AS A PHILOSOPHER. 7

study of philosophy, which had always had charms for him, and
whichhehadkeptupthroughlifein intervalsofleisure. Inthisway
he thought he would continue best to serve hiscountry, if through

¹ his efforts he could spread a taste for philosophy and reclaim the

manners of the age. Fired with this ambition, he embarked
with fresh energy on his magnificent and long-cherished design
of imitating the encyclopaedic method of an Aristotle ora
Theophrastus, and rendering Greek philosophy superfluous to
his countrymen ¹.

ς 4. His works on rhetoric and oratory.

The study of rhetoric had been treated by the Peripatetic
school as a branch of philosophy. To that Cicero had con·
tributed when hewas quite young² the De Inventione, which he
afterwards despised as a mere schoolboy exercise. This had
subsequently (Β, c. 5 5) been glorified into the De Oratore, as the
wood of the pear-'tree is transformed into the pearl. The De
Oratore had been followed up some nine or ten years later
(B. c. 46 or 45) by the Orator. To the same range of subject be-
longs the De Optimo Genere Oratorum, which is the preface to
alost translation by Cicero of the speech of Aeschines against
Ctesiphon and of Demosthenes De Corona3 also the De Parti-
tione Oratoria, which is a sort of catechism of rhetoric, and as
purely technical as the De Inventione3 and thirdly the Topica,
a free adaptation from the work of Aristotle, written for the
beuefit of the lawyer Trebatius, when Cicero was on a sea
voyage in Β. c. 44. The Brutus, which was written in Β. c. 46,
before the Orator, completes the series by a comprehensive
history of Roman oratory. Here then we have one department
of philosophical disquisition, in which Cicero need fear com·
parison with no other writer in the world. For here he is on his
own ground, and is dilating on a subject, of which long prac-
tice joined to natural gifts had made him the most consummate
master.
