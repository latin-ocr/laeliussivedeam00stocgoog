valetudinem. Like our own word ‘health,’ ‘valetudo' often stands for
‘ill-health‚‘as when we say, ‘My health did not permit me to do so and
so.’ When it is meant definitely to stand sor ‘good health' ‘integra’
or‘boua' (cp. 5 ao) is generally added. Pliny the younger (Epistv, 16)
talks of a fatal illuess as ‘novissimam valetudinem) By the time of
Aulus Gellius the bad meaning had completely established itself in
common usage. See Noct. Att. XII, 9, 5 1.

e. isto officio, ‘the duty you speak of! Referring to the words of
Scaevola, ‘quod autem Nonis,' &a

a. quod. . . diois, ‘in saying,’ explanatory of the clause ‘facis amice.'§ 9.

b. tribui. Cp. 5 6—‘ Tribuebatur.’

c. ut mihi videris. ‘videri’ in Latin, like φαίνεσθαι in Greek,

. prefers the personal to the impersonal construction.

d. si quiequam. Note the emphatic force of ‘ qnisquam,' ‘ any one
at all) Cp. the line of Publius Syrus quoted by Seneca (Cous. ad Marc.
9; De Tranq Au. 11)-

‘Cuivis potest accidere, quod cuiquam‘potest?

e. Memineram Paulum, &o With this passage we may compare
T. D. III, ξ 70—‘ quid, quinon putant lugendum viris? qualis suit
Q. Maxumus efferens filiurn consularem, qualis L. Paulus duobus paucis
diebus amissis filiis, qualis Μ. Cato praetore designato mortuo filio,
quales reliqui, quos in Consolatione conlegimus.'

fi Paulum. L. Aemilius Paulus, sumamed Macedonicus from his
victory over Perseus, died in B.c. 160, that is, thirty-one years before
the time at which Laelius is supposed to be speaking. He was consul
for the first time in B. c. 182, and ‚for the second in nc. 168. He was

. theson of the consul who died at Cannae and the father of the younger
Africanus. He lost his two younger sons, one four days before his
triumph over Perseus, the other three days after. Their death was the
more lamentablc,¹ as his two elder sons, Q. Fabius Maximus Aemilianus
and P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, had been lost to his house by
adoption, and there was no one to carry on the line. The praise of his
magnanimity, which is so frequent in Cicero’s mouth (cp. Ad Fam. IV,
6, 5 1), seems to be based on a speech which he delivered to the people,
of which a notable passage has been· preserved by Valerius Maximus
(V, 10, ξ 2).

g. Gallum. C. Sulpicius Gallus was one of the most accomplished
men of his age. He was not only deeply versed in Greek literature
(Brut. l 78), but also well acquainted with astronomy (Cat. Mai. 5 49 ;
De Rep. 1, 5²1)- On the eve of the battle of Pydna, when serving aa
tribune iu the army of his friend Paulus Aemilius Macedonicus, he
