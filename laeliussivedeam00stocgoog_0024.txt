20 ’ INTRODUCTIOM

beginning of his political career he endeavoured to remedy the
depopulation of Italy by agrarian reforms, but afterwards allowed
himself to be deterred by the opposition of the nobles. Accord-
ing to the same author the sumame of ‘ Sapiens’ was conferred
upon him for his wisdom in desisting from this dangerous path,
which the Gracchi afterwards pursued to their ruin ¹. ln this
notion, however, Plutarch receives no countenance from earlier
writers, whose language always implies that Laelius was called
‘Sapiens' on account of his eminence in philosophy; ¹and
certainly, whatever the origin of the name, it was not as a man
of action, like his father or his friend, but by his renown for
learning and letters that Laelius has achieved his niche inthe
temple of fame.

ξ 17. Scipio and Laelius as orators.

Among the orators of their time Scipio and Laelius held the
first place, not for fiery utterance, like Galba or the Gracchi,
but for the elegance and purity of their language. They have
been paid the highest compliment that could be paid them in
this respect in being suspected of having had a hand in writing
the plays of Terence 2. To an after age indeed, when the
language had been wrought to its utmost polish, their style, while
revealing the hand of a master, appeared at the same time rather
hard and stiff, like the painting of a Polygnotus ³. Although by
mutual consent and among their admirers the palm of eloquence
was assigned to Laelius, perhaps to compensate him for the
superiority of Africanus in arms Cicero is inclined to reverse
this decision. He finds the style of Laelius much more rugged
and antique than that of Scipio, a fact which he ascribes to an
affected preference for archaic expressions (Brut. ξ 83). The
speech of Laelius which appears to have been most read and
admired afterwards was the ‘De ConlegiiS,' which was delivered
in his praetorship, and is referred to in our dialogue (ξ 96).
The occasion which called it forth was the proposal made by
