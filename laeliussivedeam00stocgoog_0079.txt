c. qui septem appellantur, ‘the socalled seven sages,' Sidgwick.
The earliest sorm of Greek philosophy embodied itself in short and
pithy sayings, which by this time appear pretty trite, such as ‘Know
thyseli,’ ‘All things in moderation,’ ‘It is hard to be good! The
authors of these maxims lived iu the sixth century lae. and were known
as The Seven Wise Men. Their names, according to the list given by
Plato in the Protagoras, were-

r. Thales oi Miletus. 5. Cleobulus oi Lindus.

a. Pittacus oi Mitylene. ⁶. Mysou oi Chenae.

3. Bias of Priene. 7. Chilon os Lacedaemon.

4. Solon oi Athens.
Periander of Corinth generally figures in the list instead of Myson of
Chenae (or Chen, d Χηνεύς).

d. ista. Philosophical questions, which Fannius regards as the
special province of Laelius.

e. subtilius. Thus Dicaearchus, who belonged to the Peripatetic
School, declared that the Seven were neither sages nor philosophers‚
but shrewd men oi the world with a turn ior legislation (aire σοφοὺς
οὔτε φιλοσόφους . . . συνετοὺς δέ τινας καὶ νομοθετικούς, D. L. I, 540.
Cp. Cic. De Rep. I, 512). Thales however must be excepted from
this criticism„an exception which Cicero himself makes, De Orat. 111,
§137-

β Apollinis oraculo. Cp. Cat. Mai. 5 78. The reference is to the
story told in the Apology os how Chaerephon consulted the oracle at
Delphi to know whether there was anyone wiser than Socrates, and.was
told that there was not The Scholiast on Plato professes to preserve
the words oi the oracle—

σοφὸς Σοφοκλῆς, σοφώτερος (δ’) Εὐριπίδης·
ἀνδρῶν δ’ ἁπάντων Σωκράτης σοφώτατος.
The second line is also quoted by Diogenes Laertius.

g. omnia tua in te, &c Cp. 5 503 Cat. Mai. 5 4. This was the
standing formula oi the seli-centred philosophy oi the ancient world, the
keynote oi which was αὐτάρκεια. When Bias of Priene, on the capture
oi his native city, was recommended to take as much oi his property
with him as he could, he is said to have replied, ‘I have with me all
that belongs to me’ (‘ omnia mea porto mecum‚' Paradox.1,5 8. Α
similar story is told oi Stilpo by Seneca De Const. Sap. ch. 5). cp. T.
D. V,5 3o—‘ omniaque sibiin sese esse posita ’ ς ib. 5 4² ς Menex. 247 E-

the Greek oi Apollodorus, the same sentiment is bombastically put
into the mouth oi a slave, line 139-ι in me omnis spes mihist!
