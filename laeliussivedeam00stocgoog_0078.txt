M. TULLII CICERONIS

c. velim. ‘ Velim, malim, nolim' are a modest way of expressing a
wish. ‘Ut' is commonly omitted alter them. as also aiter the impera-
tives utic, fac, sine,’ aud verbs os commanding, begging‚ and persuading.

d. animum . . . avertas. The opposite of ‘ animum advertere.’

e. ab his, ‘on their part! ‘Oritur ’ is not a passive verb, and ¹ ab'
here does not quite denote the agent.

f. respondet Laelius. That is. Laelius here plays the same part as
Cicero (under the symbol M) plays in the Tusculan Disputations, of
discussing ‘more Graeco' the subject propounded to him by his auditors.

5 6, a. Sunt ista. ‘What you say is true.'

b. appellant. Cf. T. D. IV, § 5—‘sapientiae studium vetus id
quidem in nostris, sed tamen ante Laelii aetatem et Scipionis non reperio
quos appellare possim nominatim!

c. Tribuebatur hoo. ‘This compliment used to be paid'

d. L. Acilium. This is evidently the same person who in the
Digest (1, ii, a, § 38) is called Publius Atilius, and who is there stated
to have been the first who was called Sapiens by the people. He is
mentioued along with the brothers Sextus and Publius Aelius as a
successoros Tiberius Coruncanius, who was the first professional teacher
of law at Rome (‘ante Tiberium Coruncanium publice professum
neminem traditur,' Ibid. 5 55). Before Atilius or Acilius however
Sempronius, who was consul in mc, 304, had received the cognomen of
Σοφός from the people. The sumame Σοφός was given in this instance
alone: but it would appear from Aulus Gellius that Sapiens was osten
conferred as a title of honour upon those who were learned in the law
(IV, 1, 5 16-‘ veteres iuris magistri, qui “ sapientes” appellati sunt ⁹).

ι. mriltarum rerum usum, ‘great experience ol affairs!

fi multocius, &c., ‘many instances on his part os wise prevision,
of firm action, or acute reply.’ See § 1 i.

g. cognomen . . . sapientis. Genitive of definitior, in place oi a
noun in apposition. Cp. De Fin. 11, 5 6-‘ haec vox voluptatis '; 5 7 5
ad in.—-‘ verbum ipsum voluptatis! On Cato’s sumame of Sapiens cp.
Cat. Mai. 5 5-‘ quocirca si sapientiam meam admirari soletis-quae
utinam digna esset opinione vestra nostroque cognominet’

§¹2 a. Teautem alio, &c This sentence is constructed with colloquial
looseness. lt involves what grammarians call an ⁸ anacoluthon,' i.e. it
is not finished in exactly the way which the opening leads usto expect.
‘Te antem. . . sapientem' requires ‘existimant' lor which we have
substituted, alter the sels-interruption ol the speaker, the phrase ‘hanc
esse in te sapientiam existimant,' which is further elucidate'd by an
epexegetical clause ‘ut . . .putes.’

b. nemiuem. Govemed by ‘accepimus' after the parenthesis.
Supply ‘ inisse!
