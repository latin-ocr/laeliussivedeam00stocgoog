24 INTRODUCTION.

holiday, when there came a pause in their political and sorensic
toils, dying off together, like delighted schoolboyS, and perhaps
amusing themselves by picking up shells and cockles on the
shore of Caieta or Laurentum ¹, or else retiring to some country
place-say to Laelius' villa at Formiae ², and engaging in an -
altogether undignified romp with the young Lucilius³, while

their simple dinner is being cooked. Lucilius, it may be men-
tioned, served as an ‘eques’ under Africanus at Numantia ⁴,
and lived to leave his stamp on literature, as the inventuros the
one species of poetry, which the Romans can claim as their own.
Or perhaps it is the Lavernian villa ol Scipio which they choose
for their retreat, where Scipio was once presented with a
magnificent ‘acipenser,’ a fish dear to the epicurea of Rome,
and was so lavish of his invitations to visitors to dine with him
that one Pontius, who was with him, had to whisper in his ear——
‘Scipi0, vide quid agas ; acipenser iste paucorum hominum est‚'

festival, when his most intimate friends have arranged to visit
him in his gardens. The first of all to arrive is a nephew of
his own, who comes before his uncle has had time to dress. A
daughter of the great Aemilius Paulus had allied herself with a
very poor but honourable man, Q. Aelius Tubero, whose son, of
the same name, was an ardent student of philosophy, according
to the straitest sect of the Stoics. The uncle wonders how the
:nephew has dragged himself away from his books on so tempt-
ing an occasion sor study: but Tubero replies that his books
are never engaged, whereas it is rare to find his uncle at leisure.
'They begin then to talk of the prodigy of a double sun, which
,had lately been announced to the Senate on the most reliable
authority. Scipio wishes that PanaetiuS, their great authority
on astronomy were present, but whispers a doubt as to the
absolute infallibility of that philosopher's opinions, who seemed
