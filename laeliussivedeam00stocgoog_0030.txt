and is therefore willing to oblige the company. But here we
must leave him and his friends after this peep at what is known
as ‘the Scipionic circle?

§20 Τ reatment os‘sriendsth by earlier writers.

Concerning friendship many of the sages of early Greece had
their word to say, 'which was worth saying then when the world
was young, and may he worth remembering now that it is old.
The school ol Pythagoras were especially remarkable lor the
cultivation of this virtue, and it is to that philosopher that the
three most pregnant apophthegms on the subject are attributed—

the μία ψυχή, which goes at once to the heart of the matter, the
κοινὰ τὰ φίλων and the ἰσότης φιλότης ¹. These are chapters of

philosophy in themselves, the contents of which have yet to be ’
exhausted. The utterances ol other worthies areola more
commonplace character„ Among other sound maxims which
Solon left to the world we find this on record—‘Maka not
friends quickly‚ but when you have made them he sure to keep
them ²! Bias os Priene gave that advice about loving as though
you might hate and hating as though you might love, which
Cicero in our treatise has so strongly protested against ³. Ana·
charsis said it was better to have one good friend than many
bad ones ⁴. But it is not till we come down to Plato that we
have a piece of writing on the subject of friendship. The Lysis
of that author is a dialogue of the ‘maeeutic’ or elicitory order,
and a peculiarly provoking specimen of its class. lt is logical,

subde, suggestive, but it plays with ideas as a child plays with
a packof cards, and ends by leaving them strewn in confusion.
Cicero has horrowed nothing from it, and, for aught we know,
may never have read it. Aristotle's περὶ φιλίας, which has come
down to us as Books Vlll and IX of the Nicomachean Ethics‚
