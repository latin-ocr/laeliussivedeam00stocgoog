b. familiaris meus. P. Terentius Afer, commonly known as Terence.
He was on such intimate terms with both Laelius and Scipio, that
they were eredited with having had a hand in the composition of his
plays. See the lite of Terence ascribed to Suetonius (ch. a)—‘ Non
obscura fama est, adiutum Terentium in seriptis a Laelio et Scipione,
quibuscum familiariter vixit! Cicero himself writing to Atticus (VII, 3,
510) says-⁴ Terentium, cuins fabellae propter elegantiam sermonis
putabantur a C. Laelio scribi! In the life of Terence we have the fol·
lowing words quoted from the speech of Q. Memmius ‘pro se’—‘ P.
Africanus, qui a Terentio personam mutuatus, quae domi luserat ipse,
nornine illins in scenam detulit’ This would make Scipio stand to
Terence in the supposed relation of Bacon to Shakespeare. But the fol-
lowing anecdote, quoted from Nepos, as being ascertained by him on
good authority, would transfer the chief responsibility to Laelius. That
nobleman was spending the 1st of March at his villa at Puteoli. This
day, it will be remembered, was that Saturnalia ofwomankind on which
Horace as a bachelor hardly knew what to do with himself (Carm. III,
8). So when Laelius' wife reminded him that he was to dine earlier than
usual that d'ay, he recognised her authority, but at the same time humbly
begged that he might not be interrupted. When at last he did make his
appearance in the dining-room, he said that he had seldom succeeded
better in writing. After this there was nothing to do but to ask him to
quote, and he proceeded to deliver himself of the passage in the Heauton-
timorumenus (723, dcc.) beginning-

‘Satis pol proterve me Syri promissa hue induxerunt,'
of which it may be remarked in passing that it is by no means in 'Terence’s
happiest vein. These reports of help from noble persons were current
in Terence‘s own time, being perhaps disseminated by his enemy Lus-
cius Lanuvinus. Terence himself was far too good a courtier to con·
tradict them. See his words in the prologue to the Adelphi (15-21).

c. Obsequiumamicos, &c ‘Compliance produces friends, sincerity
dislike.'

d. fraudem. ‘F raus’ sometimes means ⁴ harm,’ ‘mischief' or some
unpleasant consequence of action. Cp. Pro Rosc. Am. § 58 adsim-‘Haec
te opinio falsa in istam fraudem impulit'; Liv. XXIV, 10, ς 5.
