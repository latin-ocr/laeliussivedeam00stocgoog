secret of this peculiar charm lies in the fact that they were
philosophers and men ol letters as well as soldiers and states·
men.

ξ 15. The younger Scipio.

The time of the later Scipio and Laelius was for Cicero the
goldeu age of Rome. lt was a time when men were equally
conspicuous for the purity of their lives and of their language1;
it was a time when the learning ol Greece had come in and
the virtue of Rome had not gone out; it was a time of
great achievements in action, but also os a newly-awakened
thirst for literature, like the age of the Renaissance‚ when the
dying embers ol Greece sufficed again to rekindle Italy. And
the central figures of this great age were entwined in a friendship
which Cicero has rendered immortal. Bom about ue. 185, it
is not long before Scipio figures on the field of history. Hearrd
his elder brother, Quintus Fabius Maximus, were both present
at the battle of Pydna (ue. 168), while Scipio was still in his
17th year. At the close oi the day the younger and favourite
son of the consul was missing, and his disappearance caused
anguish to his father and consternation in the camp. The
soldiers left their supper and went out with torches to look for
him. At last he came in covered with blood along with one
or two comrades. The ardour oi the chase had carried him
away, like awell-bred puppy, as Plutarch puts it, arrd he had
pursued the enemy far into the night ². When the Third Punic
War brolre out in rac. 149 Scipio first served as tribune os the
soldiers and won so much distinction in that capacity for his
prudence and valour, that Catu, to whose policy the war was
due, exclaimed oi him in the words of Homer-

οἶος πέπνυται, τοὶ δὲ σκιαὶ ἀΐσσουσι ³.

This testimony was the more valuable‚ as Cato had been an
enemy to the former Africanus. The sage did not live to see -

the verification of his prophecy : but his opinion was confirmed
