who rose by sheer force of intellectual ability (Brut. 5 96)· . but, though
elever, he was unprincipled—‘ callide improbus' is Cicero‘s description
of him in the De Finibus II, 5 54 (cp. De Ofi. ΙΙΙ, 5 109). He was
elected consul in nc. 141 along with Cn. Servilius Caepio. Laelius
was bis defeated rival. He is said to have thrown Laelius off his guard
by declaring that he did not mean to stand. Hence the quarrel referred
to iu the text. Ten years later (sc. 131) he was censor along with Q.
Metellus Macedonicus. This year is remarkable for the fact that then

Claudius Pulcher, and carried on war with successiu N earer Spain until
n.c.141‚ when he was succeeded by Q. Pompeius. His unpatriotic
conduct on this occasion, iu haudiug over the army to his successor in as
inefficieut a state as possible, is a blot on an otherwise unblemished career
(Val. Max. IX, 3, 5 7). Ten years later (Β. c. 131) he was censor along
with this hated rival (see 5 2 22). Metellus was a statesmau aud orator
