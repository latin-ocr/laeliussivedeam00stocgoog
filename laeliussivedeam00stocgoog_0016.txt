12 , INTRODUCTION.

and the Hortensius De Philosophia. The sub-title might be
used in place of the title of a book, and was naturally often so
employed when any stress was meant to be laid upon the nature
of the contenta. When Cicero in the De Divinatione is enumer-
ating his philosophica] works lre does not use the name Cato
Maior, but talks oi ‘liber is quem adnostrum Atticum de
senectute misimus ¹.' There is, however, in this passage a deii-
nite reason lor refraining from employing the proper title of the
ι work, namely the desire to avoid confusion, since in the very
next sentence Cicero speaks ol his panegyric on Cato Uticensis
under the title ol ‘ Cato! lt was to distinguish it from this work
that the ‘maior' was added to the name of the treatise on old age.
We have spoken already of the actual date of composition of
. our dialogue. But in a work oi imagination like this two other
dates have to be taken into account, namely, the supposed date
oi the occurrence ol the dialogue and the supposed date ol its
narratron.

ᾗ 9. Cicero's respect for history.

ln respect of the historical setting of his dialogues Cicero
presents a strong contrast to Plato. The Greek had dwelt in the
world of ideas until facts had become to him mere counters to
play with, not coins to use, his dirilogues are the despair
‚ oi commentators who seek to run a nali-through these gossamer
webs and pin them down to the world of reality; he does not
mind making Socrates discourse on facts which took place long
after he was dead: there was Socrates and th'ere were facts-
why not see how the one would deal with the other? The
Roman on the other hand, with his national respec't for reality,
has a strongly developed historical conscience3 he binds him·
seli down under stringent laws ol time, place and circumstance 3
his characters must refer to no events or persons, with which
they could not be supposed as a matter ollact to be acquainted ².
