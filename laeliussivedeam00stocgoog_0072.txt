M. TULLII CICERONIS

the adjective ‘memor,‘ as ‘graviter' from ‘gravis’ The precise sense
oi the adjective which is reflected hythe adverb ‘ memoriter' is found
in De Ieg. 1, 5 22—‘ animal hoc providum, sagax, multiplex, acutum,
memor, plenum rationis et consilii, quem vocamus hominem!

d. sapientem. The ‘ sapieus’ is defined by Lactantius (Div. Iust.

111, 13) to be theman who possessas the art of lire-⁴ cuius doctrina est,
quomodo vivere oporteat' Thus the term corresponds to the φρόνιμος,
and not to the σοφός, of Aristotle. In the De Officiis, 1, 5 153, it is true,
‘sapientia’ is identified by Cicero with σοφία, while ‘ prudentia' is used
to translate φρόνησις. The latter is defined to be ⁴ rernm expetendarum
fugiendarumque scientia,' the former ‘rerum divinarum atque humanarum
scientia.’ But the σοφία of Aristode, which was the exercise of thought
simply aud solely for its own sake, is an idea which the practicai Roman
mind never really entertained. The Romans followed the Stoice, who
reversed the decision of Aristotle as to the comparative merits of the
contemplative and practical life.

e. ita . . . ut, ‘with the view that? Cp. 5 19-‘ ita natos esse nos,
ut,' &o

f. ad Scaevolam, i. e. Ὠ. Mucius angur'mentioned above. Scaevola
did not profess to teach law, but allowed young men to listen when he
was giving his answers as jurisconsult. See Brut. 5306—‘ ego autem
juris civilis studio multum operae dabam Q. Scaevolae Q. F .‚ qui quam-
quam nemini se ad docendum dabat, tamar consulentibus respondendo
studiosos audiendi docebat!

g. sumpta virili toga. Cicero assumed the garh of manhood at the
usual age, namely sixteen. Before this he was a ‘praetextatus’ (Pro
Sest. 5 1443 Phil. 11, 5 44), that is, he wore a white toga with a purple
border similar to that which was worn by magistrates. Perhaps it wa!
to encourage their ambition that the free-born youth of Rome were thus
clad. But at the age of sixteen or thereahouts they appeared before the
praetor in the Forum and solemnly laid aside their childhood's gerb
(‘praetexta toga,’ 5 33), assuming in its stead the plain white robe known
as the ‘toga pura’ or ‘virilis‘ The ceremony took plaoe early in the
morning (Pro Mur. 5 69).

Ιι. quoad possem et liceret, ‘so far as I could and might?
‘Liceret’ seems to refer to the permission of Scaevola.

i. multa ab eo prudenter mantea, &c., ‘many wise discussions
of his, many brief and pithy seyings.¹ In such constructions the past
participle is arrested as it were in the act of passing into asubstantive. In
strict grammar‘multa’ is here the substantive and ‘ disputata' the adjec-
tive, bnt the mind involuntarily reverses this relation, while on the other
hand the adverb which clinga to ‘disputata' still serves to show its parti·
cipial nature. Cp. 5 6—‘ multa eius . . . provisa. . .acta . . . responsa?
