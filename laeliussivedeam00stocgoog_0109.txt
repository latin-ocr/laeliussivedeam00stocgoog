s. Themistocle. It was Themistocles who persuaded the Atheniens
to build a fleet (Hdt. VII, 144), audit was to his policy that the victory
of the Greeks over the Persians at Salamis (lac. 480) was due. He was
first ostracized by his countrymen and retired to Argos3 then, being
implicated by the Spartans in the treason ol Pausanias, he fled to
Artaxerxes, king of Persia, who received him royally (Thuc. Ι, 135-
138).

a'coriolanus. §36a

i. mortem sibl, &c This seems to be said ou the principle which
Atticus, a careful historiari, is made to enounce sarcastically in the
Brutus (ς 4a)-‘quouiam quidem concessum est rhetoribus ementiri in
historiis, ut aliquid dicere possint argutius! Atticus himself had dis-
posed of the legendary suicide of Coriolanus. With regard to
Themistocles, Cicero shows himself avvare in the Brutus that Thucydides
is our best authority. Now Thucydides merely says (l, 138, ξς 6, 7)...
νοσήσας δὲ τελευτᾷ τὸν βίον· λέγουσι δέ τινες καὶ ἑκούσιον φαρμάκῳ ·
ἀποθανεῖν αὐτόν, ἀδύνατον νομίσαντα eluat ἐπιτελέσαι βασιλεῖ ἃ ὑπέσχετο.
The myth of his having sacrificed a bull aud killed himself by drinking
its blood first appeared in Clitarchus or Stratocles.

a. non modo, ‘not merely’ ξ 43.

b. vel, ‘even’

c. ut res ire coepit. The murder of Tiberius Gracchus inaugurated
a century of civil war. Before that the most bitter strifes had been
settled by mutual concessions without an appeal to arms.

a. Haeo igitur· prima, &c A repetition in a positive form of the ᾧ 44.
precept given negatively in § 40, ad fin.

α, Nam quibusdam, &c ‘For certain people, whom I hear to ξ 45.
have been accounted sages in Greeee, have adopted,I think, some strange
opinions! After Cicero’s time ‘ placita' became the regular word for
the dogmas of philosophers. Sen. Epist. 95—‘ Praeterea nulla ars
contemplativa sine decretis suis est, quae Graeci vocant δόγματαε nobis
decreta licet appellare, vel scita, vel placita’

b. persequantur argutiis, ‘pursue into subitarias!

c. fugiendas esse minias, &c ln the wholeof the passage which
follows Cicero has in view the well-known lines of Euripides in the
Hippolytus (affl-260), which may freely be rendered thus-

‘Let friendship’s cup be tempered well,
Not mixed to passion's strength;
And hold with care the reins of love,

Nor give them all their length.
