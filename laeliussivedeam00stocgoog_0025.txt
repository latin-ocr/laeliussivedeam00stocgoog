SCIPIO ΛΝΒ LAELIUS AS ORATORS. 21

the demagogue C. Licinius Crassus to throw open the priestly
colleges to popular election. As the art of augury was one of
the chief weapons of popular control in the hands of a dominant
aristocracy, all the conservatism of Rome was up in arms at this
proposal. Laelius figured as the defender of the saith, and
delivered a speech upon religion, which Cicero makes Cotta
speak of as ‘oratio nobilis² and ‘aureola oratiuncula ¹? Yet he
says that this speech is no better than any one out of many of
Scipio’st This verdict of Cicero’s is confirmed by Aulus
Gellius, who speaks of Scipio as the purest speaker of his age ³.
Another occasion referred to in the text (ξ 96) on which both
orators exerted their powers, was in opposing the bill brought
forward by C. Papirius Carbo, to legalise the re-election of
tribunes. Carbo was supported by C. Gracchus, but the bill

dancing, which somehow found a place in his speech against the

of invective against a tribune of the commons, Tiberius
Claudius Aselius, whom Scipio had degraded during his censor-
ship(13.C. 142), and who afterwards sought to have his revenge
upon him by accusing him before the peoplel.

wishing to express in one word the prevailing characteristic of
each orator of the time, Cicero chooses ‘gravitas' for Scipio and
