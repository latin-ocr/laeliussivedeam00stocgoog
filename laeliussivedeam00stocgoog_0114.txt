M. TULLII CICERONIS

j. imperio, potestate. The former is strictly used of military, the
latter of civil command.

ᾗ 55, a. copiis, facultatibus, opibus, ‘wealth, means and resources,'
§51d. ,

b. vestem egregiam. ‘Vestis' is often used as a collective noun =
‘wardrobe’ Cp. Phil. 11, ξ 66—‘permagnum optimi pondus argenti,
pretiosa vestis, multa et lauta supellerc’

c. supellectilem. The simile is no doubt suggested by Xen. Mem.
11, 4, 5 ι-ὦς πάντων κτημάτων κράτιστον ἂν εἴη φίλος σαφὴς καὶ ἀγαθός,
and ξ 5-ιεαὶτοι πρὸς τοῖον κτῆμα τῶν ἄλλων παραβαλλόμενος ψιλὸς ἀγαθὸς
οὐκ ἂν πολλῷ κρείττων φανείη 3

d. qui vincit viribus. Henoe they are called τὰ περιμάχητα ἀγαθά.
See E. N. IX, 8, 5 9-προὴπεται γὰρκαὶ χρήματα καὶ τιμὰς καὶ ὅλως τὰ
περιμάχητα ἀγαθά, περιποιούμενος ἑοοπῷ τὸ καλόν. Wealth and honour
are of such a nature that plus ior A means minus sor B in the scramble
oi life; but the higher goods of virtue and wisdom and kindness are
like light that can be imparted without being lost. Their possession by
A tends to promote their possession by B.

e. possessio, ‘property’

f. ut, ‘insomuch that! Cicero writes as though he had said explicitly
that friendship is superior to the goods oi fortune.

g. hactenus. A standing formula ior the conclusion of one part of a
subject. Cp. 5 24-‘ Hactenus mihi videor,' &c., at the close oi the first
section of the ‘ partitio' (⁴quid sentiret’). So in De Div. 11, 5 53—‘ sed
haec hactenus; nunc ad ostenta veniamus?

p 56, a. fines ot qussi termini, ‘the limits and boundaries as it were!
These words are evidently meant as the Latin equivalent for the Greek
word ὅροι in one oi its multifarions applications. But the meaning oi
ὅρος in this connexion is much closer to the primary one than that of
either ‘term’ or ‘ definition.'

b. diligendi. Genitive of the gerund. The reading ‘deligendi,'
which Baiter has here, seems out of keeping with his punctuation. Per-
haps what Cicero wrote was ‘dilegendi' = ‘ diligendi!

c. terri, ‘proposed’

d. adfecti simus. ‘Adiecti' is here au adjective, like ‘animatus’
in t 57·

ι. ut, quanti quisque, &c., ‘that whatever value each man sets upon
himself, the same should be set upon him by his friends?

f. faciat. The subjunctive here seems to bedue to Halm. ou the
analogy of ξ 59. ‘Facit’ which is the common reading in this passage,
is quite defensihle.

η 53⁴ a. definit amicitiam, &c., ‘limita friendship to an equality oi ser-
vice and goodwill.’
