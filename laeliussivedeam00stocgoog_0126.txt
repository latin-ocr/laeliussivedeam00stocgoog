M. TULLII CICERONIS

follow them: the latter was felt to be the lesser evil. Cp. De lnv. ΙΙ,
5 19—‘ siquod ad facinus‚' ΙΙ, 5 ,aa—‘si quo in pari ante peccato . . . .
si quam in similem aute suspitionem?

e. futura est. An elementary instance of the tendency to analysis
spoken of in 5 30 e.

f. ad, ‘towards the attainment of?

§84⁶ a. honestas. τὸ καλόν.

b. cloria. τιμή, the end of the πολιτικὸς βίος. Ε. Ν. Ι, 5, 5 4.

c. tranquillitas animi atqua iucunditas. The view of the Epi-
cuream, as expounded in the first bools of the De Finibus. See
especially 5 37.

d. et oum haec adsint, &c They are therefore the causes of the
happy life. For a cause may be defined as ‘that without which some-
thing would not be, and, given which, something is.' ,

e. Quod ‘Quod ’ seems to refer to ‘societas' ε but the language is
vague and rhetorical.

f. opera danda. ‘Operam dare' is ‘to pay attention to.' It also

horse.’

c. cohaesimus, ⁴ shut the stable-door after the steed is stolen.’ The
proverbial expression ‘acta agere' has reference to doing a thing too

forbidden to plead a cause that had been duly pleaded already (‘ne
quis rem actam apud iudices repetat,' Donatus). Cp. Plaut. Pseudl,
32 ²7-

‘mortua re, verba nunc facis.
Stultus es, rem actam agis!
Cist. IV, a, 56—
‘Actam rem ago. quod periit, periit?
Terence, Phormio 419-
· “‘actum‚“’ aiunt, “¹ne agas.'' ’
Terence also supplies us with a good commentary on the force of the
expression in Adelphi 232-
‘nunc si hoc omitto ac tum agam nbi illinc rediero,
nil est; refrixerit res.’

d. ultro et eiuro, ‘mutually‚' ‘reciprocally.' Cp. De Oli. Ι, 5 56-
