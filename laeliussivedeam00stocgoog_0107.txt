ment of Plutarch, was nine years younger than his brother Tiberius. As
Tiberius, according to the same authority, perished under thirty, Gaius
cannot then have been more than twenty. He possessed all his brother's
virtue and more than his brother's ability (Vell. Pat. Il, 6, 5 Ι). For a
long time he hesitated to follow in his steps : but when he did make up
his mind to do so, it was with a reckless energy‚ as though he meant to
court destruction. Indeed lhe story runs that the shade of Tiberius ap·
peared to him in a dream, telling him to hesitate uo longer, as one end
awaited both. His first tribuneship was in 13.c.125. He was reap-
pointed for the year 122, without having sued for the office. His
influence secured the consulship for C. Fannius Strabo in preference to
Opimius, the destroyer of Fregellae. But Opimius was elected for the
next year, and meantime the influence of Gracchus had been undermined
. by Livius Drusus, who outbid him in popular favour iu the interests of

th'e senate. The accidental murder of an obscure'persou named Quintus
Antyllius (Plut. C. Grac. 13) or Antyllus (App. Bell. Civ. 25) afforded
the senate a pretext for arming Opimius with special powers to secure
the safety of the State. The result was the destruction of Gracchus,
Fulvius Flaccus and their following. Even the young son of Flaccus,
who had been employed as an intermediary, was murdered in cold blood
by Opimius. Gracchus himself did not raise a hand against his country.
He fied to the grove of the Furies, cursed the people for their ingrati-
tude, and employed a slave to kill him.
