M.¹ TULLII CICERONIS

contemporary with Epicurus, and according to Cicero was much manda·
lized at his doctrine, of which he heard from Cineas the Thessalian
(Cat. Mai. 543). His merit was considered so great that he was
buried within the walls of Rome, though that was forbidden by a law
of the Twelve Tables (De Leg. 11, 5 58).

s. Μ’. curtum. Cp. 55 28, ²9 aud Cat. Mai. 55 15, 43, De N. D. 11,
5 165, in all which passages these three worthies are mentioned together.
They were contemporaries and friends, and their iriendship was founded
on similarity oi character. M'. Curius Dentatus first distinguished him-
self as tribune oi the commone, when he compelled the senate to ratify
beiorehand the election osa plebeian consul, whom Appius Claudius · l
Caecus, in his capacity oi interrex, wished to reject (Brut. i 55). Aster-
wards he was made consul three times-in 290, ²7 5, and 274 tae. In
his first consulship he triumphed over the Samnites and Sabines3 in his
second he had the glory os expelling Pyrrhus from Italy, and led iour
elephante in his triumph (Eutrop. Il, 14). Such was his integrity that
he was able to swear that he had touched nothing out of all the spoil he
had taken except a beechen fiask with which to sacrifice (Plin. N. H.
XVI, 38, 5 185). The story of his rejecting the gift of the Samnites is
slmilar to that told of Fabricius (see Cat. Mai. 55 55, 56; De Rep. III,
540 ad fin.; Val. Max. IV, 3, 5 5).

g. nt. Commoaniurn. Tiberius Comncanius was a ‘novus homo’
(Vell. Pat. 11, 5 128), coming like Manius Curius irom a municipium
(Pro Sulla, 5 23). Nevertheless he also achieved the highest honours
os the State. He was elected consul in 13. c. 280, and was the first
plebeian who was made ‘pontifex maximus'(Liv.Epit.18). He was
more famous as a lawyer than as a soldier. It is mentioned in the
Digest (I, ii. a, 5 38) that he was the first professional jurisconsult. He
leit uo writings, but many of his ‘ responsa' were rcmembered (Cp. De
leg. 11, 5 52). In Brut. 5 55 Cicero says that the ‘pontificum commen·
tarii' give proci of his surpassing ability. One of his pronouncements
on ritual is preserved by Pliny (N. H. VIII, 51, 5 206).

Ιι. ad Istorum normam, ‘aster their pattem.’ ‘Norma ' is literally a
T square used by carpenters. Hence ‘abnormal' of what does not
square with a rule.

ι’. concedant ut viri boui tuerint. ΤΙιε acc. with infin. is more
usual aster ‘concedo’ to express the proposition granted.

ᾗ 19. a. pingui, ut aiunt, Minerva, ‘with coarse mother-wit, as they
say! Cp. Hor. Sat. 11, 2, 3-
‘ rusticus, abnormis sapiens crassaque Minerva?

b. cupiditas, libido, audacto„ Cp. Lact. Div. Inst. VI, 19-‘ Tres
sunt igitur affectus, qui homines in omnia facinora praccipites agunt, ira,
cupiditas, libido. Propterea poetae tres furias esse dixerunt, quae
