M. TULLII CICERONIS

Sometimes ‘omnium' is added to ‘unns’ to impart still greater emphasis,
e. g. Brut. 5 25—‘ rem unam esse omnium difficillimam'

m. et ingenio et iustitia, ‘both for ability and uprightuess.'

n. alias, ‘on other occasions,' e. g. De Orat. 1, 5 180, 111, 5 ιος
Brut. 55 145-8; Pro Rosc. Am. §333 DeOff.1.§116,III,§6a;De
Leg. II, 5 47; De N. D. III, 5 80, where he is called ‘temperantiae
prudentiaeque specimen) ι

§2 a. (ium . . .tum. ‘Among many other thingslremember! There
is a zeugma involved by the nse of ‘ illurn incidere’ following, for this only
suits the ‘ tum memini' and not the ‘cnm saepe multa! With the former
we may supply ‘illum dicere?

b. hemicyclio. ‘Hemicyclium’(hurndataovl=semicircular. Here it
is probably used for a row of seats arranged in a semicircle. Perhaps
Cicero had the opening of the Republicin his mind atthis point (328 c)-
ἒκαθεζόμεθα οὖν παρ’ αὐτόν· ἔκειντο γὰρ δίφροι τινὲς iuria κύκλῳ.

c. in eum sermonem, ue, ‘ his entering on that topic'

d. innidere. 'lhe present infinitive is usual after ‘memini’ when a
personal reminiscence is being spoken of. Cp. 5 1r-‘ memini Catonem
disserere ;’ Cat. Mai. 5 30-‘ Ego L. Metellum memini puer.. . ita bonis
esse viribus;’ De Orat. I, 5 24-‘ dici mihi memini’ When the fact has
not come within the immediate experience of the subject, the perfect is
always employed, and may also be employed when it has. Thus in
Pro Rosc. Am. 5 122 we have (in the and person)—‘ Meministis me ita
distribuisse initio causam,’ and in 5 4 below (in the 3rd)—‘dispntata ab
eo meminisset Scaevola!

e. fere multis. A slight redundancy‚ as ‘fere' adds nothing to the
idea of ‘ multis:

flP. Sulpicio. P. Sulpicius Rufus was one of the greatest orators .
of his day. His style was tragic in its intensity‚ his voice full and
mellow, and his gesture and movements grateful and dignified: buthe
lacked the wit of Crassus, whom he took for his model (Brut. 5 2033
cp. De Orat. 1, 5 27). At first he was regarded as one of the rising
hopes of the aristocratical party, who smiled upon his candidature for
the tribuneship (De Orat. Ι, 5 25). He is described by Velleius Pater·
culus as ‘disertus acer, opibus, gratia, amicitiis, vigore ingenii atque
animi celeberrimus) Bnt his talents and influence were lost to his
party, when he obtained the tribuneship in lac. 88. For he flung him·
self into the cause of the commons, and among other popular resolutioris
proposed to transfer the command against Mithridates from Sulla to
Marius It was these measures that led to Sulla’s march upon Rome,
and to the first pitched battle within the walls of the city. Marius and
Sulpicius fled before their victorious antagonist, by whom a price was
set upon their heads. Sulpicius hid himself in avilla, but was betrayed
