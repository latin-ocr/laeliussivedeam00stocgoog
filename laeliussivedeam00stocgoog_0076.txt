M. TULLII CICERONIS

of his father-in-law he had studied under the Stoic philosopher Panaetius.
He is described by Cicero in the Brutus (t 100 odfin.) as ‘et moribus
et ipso genere dicendi durior! He was the author of a history of which
Cicero speaks in terms of moderate praise. ln it he recorded how he
and the celebrated Tiberius Gracchus had been the first to scale the
walls of the enemy when serving under the younger Scipio in Africa
(Plut Tib. Grac. 4). Fannius also figures in the De Republica

c. antenctae memoriae mundavi. The ascription ot the ideas or
sentiments of the following discourse to Laelius may safely be regarded
as nothing more than a literary artifice.

d. quasi enim ipsos, &c Dialogues may be divided into two
kinds, the dramatic and narrated. In the dramatic dialogue only the
speeches of the interlocutors are given; in the narrated they are oon·
nected by a thread of story. The first kind is the less troublesomer
the second involves a strain upon the credulity of the reader, owing to
the prodigious memory that must be possessed by the recitet, bnt has
the advantage of allowing the author to uotify from time to time the
circumstances of time and place and the play of character and feeling.
The dramatic dialogue has often an introduction prefixed in order to
compensate in some measure forits absence of setting. Of Plato’s
dialogues those which are couched in the narrated form are the Phaedo‚

Parmenides, symposium, Anterastae, Charmides, Lysis, Euthydemus,
Protagoras, and Republic; the rest are dramatic. The bulk of Cicero's
dialognes on the other hand are in the narrated form. This is the case
with the De Oratore, which is supposed to be narrated by Cotta, with
the Brutus, the Posterior and Prior Academias, the De F inibus, the De

Natura Deorum, De Divinatione, De Fato, and Timaeus, all of which
are supposed to be narrated by Cicero himself, aud lastly with the
De Republica, which is supposed to be narrated by P. Rutilius Rufus.
It was easier for Cicero to adopt this form, as the sharp swerd-play of
dialectic is absent from his writings. Only iu five of his dialogues has
Cicero preferred the dramatic form. These arethe De Partitione
Oratoria, which is a dialogue, without introduction, held between
Cicero and his son, the Tusculan Disputations, a series of scholae, in
which Cicero, after the manner of the Greek sophists, is supposed to
discuss the subject propounded by the hearer, the Cato Maior, the
Laelius and the De Legibus, the form of which is doubtless mcdelled
on the Laws of Plato. The Paradoxa Stoicorum are in part what may
be called ‘altercatione‘ or ‘rhetorical dialogues,’ that isan opponent is
sometimes assumed in them for the purposes of argument. The rest of
Cicero's prose works are either treatises or speeches.
