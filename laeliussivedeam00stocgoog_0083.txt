na Anrcrm. noras: §t 9-11.

misereri, invidere, gestire, laetari, haec omnia morbos (πάθη) Graeci

appellant, motus animi rationi non obtemperantes!

f. negem . . mentiar. The event is still possible, hence we have
not the imperi. subj., but it is intimated that it will not actually
occur.

g. viderint sapientes. ‘Let the philosophers see to it? The
jussive use os the perfect subjunctive. We are more familiar with itin
prohibitions, eg. Livy XXI, 44, § 6-‘ Ne transieris Hiberum.³

Ιι. sed certe. The intrusion oi these words involves a slight anaco-
luthon. They are dne to the thought which occurred on the way,
‘quam id recte,’ &c The cast oi the passage is like Livy XXIII, 47,
5 8 ‘Huic pugnae equestri remquam vera sit, communis existimatio

, est (‘ every one may judge ior himself ’), mirabilem certe adiiciunt
quidam annales!

i. confirmare. Stronger than ‘affirmare’z ‘positively assert'

accidit? ‘Any that has happened has happened to me?

b. quod . . . putabat, ‘an idea that never entered his head?

c. inmortalitatem, ‘exemption from death‚’ immortality oi earthly
existence: not asin} 14-—‘ de inmortalitate animorum! '

d. optare, ‘to pray sor.’ Livy IV, 15, §6—‘cni tribunatus plebis
magis optandus quam sperandus fuit! Lact. Div. Inst. II, 1—‘Narn et
cum iurant et cum optant et cum gratias agunt, non Iovem aut Deos
multos, sed Deum nominane' See 18 d.

c. primum, ac, 147, when Scipio was about thirty-eight, whereas
the legal age ior the consulship was Tomy-three. Velleius Paterculus
(II, 4, 5 7) says that Scipio was elected to his first consulship at the age
oi thirty-six and died at the age oi fifty-soar. The way in which he
says it shows that it was not the prevalent opinion.

fi iterum, nc. 134, when he was appointed to the command at
Numantia. .
