· e. perspicere videamur. Virtnal oblique oration. The reason is
given, not as a fact, but as our way of looking at the fact. The
lengthened ending ‘perspicere videamur,' where ‘perspiciamus' would
have done, is a note oi Cieero’s style'. Cp. Pro'Rosc. Am. ’5 153-
‘videte, per deos immortalis, quem in locum rempublicam perventuram
putetis! Here ‘perventura sit ’would have adequately expressed the
meaning. Quintilian (X, a, ἕξ 17, 18) derides the servile imitators of
Cicero who affected a similar redundancy. ‘Otiosi et supini, siquid
modo longius circumduxerunt, iurant ita Ciceronem locuturum fuisseL
Noveram quosdam, qui se pulchre expressisse genus illnd coelestis
huius in dicendo viri sibi viderentur, si in clausula posuissent csse

e. Tarquinium Superbum. L. Tarquinius Superbus was the seventh
and last lring of Rome (Β. c. 534-510), whose atrocities led to the founda-
tion of the Republic.

ſs sp. Gessium. Spurius Cassius Viscellinus was consul in Β. e. 502,
493, and 486. In his third consulship he proposed the first agrarian
law. It failed to please either party in the State. The patricians were
alarmed because their possession of the public lands was threatened,
and the commons were disgusted at the Latins and allies being included
along with themselves in the distribution. Cassius was aecused ol

aiming at royalty, and was condemned and executed as soon as he re-
signed office (Livy Il, 41).
g. sp. Maelium. Cp. Cat. Mai. t 56. The case ol Spurius Maelius

presents a close parallel to that of Spurius Cassius. In the year 440
Β. c. there uvas famine at Rome, aud a ‘praefectus annonae' was ior the
first time appointed, in the person oi L. Minucius. He did nothing to
stave off the distress, and the people were flinging themselves into the
Tiber rather than face the horrors oi starvation. At this crisis Sp.
Maelius, a wealthylrnight, cameto the rescue. He bought up corn
from Etruria, which he distributed among the people. As a result he
became very popular. Minucius then discovered that a dangerons con·
spiracy was being carried on in Maelius' house for the overthrow oi the
state. He laid the matter before the senate. The consuls oi 439 com-
plained that they were hampered by the laws of appeal, which were in·
tended ior the dissolution oi the empire. Next morning the people
were surprised to see the venerable L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, who was
over eighty years of age, appear as dictator, with C. Servilius Ahala as
