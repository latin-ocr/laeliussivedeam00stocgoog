M. TULLII CICERONIS

§lb a. adsentior. A middle voice both in form aud meaning=join
myseli iu assent to.

b. nuper disserere. In the debete in the Senate during Cicero's
consulship (B. c. 63) as to the fate of Catiline's adherents Caesar had
declared ‘in luctu atque miseriis mortem aerumnarum requiemnon
cruciatum esse; eam cuncta mortalium mala dissolvere, ultra neque
curae neque gaudio locum esse’ (Sall. Cat. 51, ς 20). The doctrines os
Epicurus had been gaining ground lately among the Romans. In
Cioero’s eyes they were ‘the enemy‚' and it was chiefly as a counter·
blest to them that he uudertoolr his championship oi the Academy.
The most powerlul exposition of the Epicurean philosophy that has
ever been given is that by Lucretius, but it made singularly little
impression on the minds oi his countrymeu. Cicero just mentions him
in reply to his brother Quintus (11‚9,s 3-‘ Lucretii poemata, ut scribis,
ita sunt, multis luminibus ingenii, multae etiam artis'). It was chiefly
through the medium of a writer named Amafinius (or Amafanius)
that the doctrines ol Epicurus became known to the Romans. See
T. D. IV, t 6-‘C. Amafinius exstitit dicens, cuius libris editis
commota multitudo contulit se adeam potissimum disciplinam'3 and
cp. Acad. Post. 1, ἧς 5, 6. Amafinius seems to have had a host
of followers. T. D. IV, t 7-—‘ post Amafinium autem multi eiusdem
aemuli rationis multa cum scripsissent, Italiam totam occupave-
runt.’

c. antiquorum. The Academie and Peripatetic schools back to
Plato and Aristotle.

d. nostrorum maiorum. This form os the argument from authority
had always much weight with the conservative Roman mind. See the
words oi Cotta on the subject in N. D. ΙΙΙ, §5 5, 6, and especially his
enouncemeut oi the duty oi blind beliei—‘ maioribus autem uostris
(debeo) etiam nulla ratione reddita credere) When Christianity was
still struggling for acceptance, its defendere asserted the right oi private
judgment aud anticipated the apophthegm of Bacon—‘ Antiquitas
saeculi iuventus mundi' Thus we find Lactantius sayiug (Div. Inst.
11, 7)—‘ Nec quia nos illi temporibus antecesserunt, sapientia quoque
antecesserunt’

e. si nihil... arbitrarentur, ‘ii they thought that they (i. e. the
“ religiosa iura'’) iu no way concemed them! The argument is that
the care bestowed upon the dead indicates a belief in their survival.
For why should we coucem ourselves ou their behalf in that which does
not concern them? The argument here is not the same asin Cat. Mai.
ξ 80-—‘ nec vero clarorum virorum post mortem honores permanereut‚si
nihil eorum ipsorum animi efficerent, quo diutius memoriam sni tenere«
mus’: but very possibly it is suggested by the same words oi Xenophon
