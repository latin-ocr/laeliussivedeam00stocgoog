DRAMATIC DATE OF THE‘DJALOGUE. 13

§ 10. Dramatic date os tlte dz'alogue. ’

ln the choice of both these imaginary dates Cicero has dis-
played exquisite literary art. What more striking or pathetic
occasion could he have chosen on which to make Laelius dis·
course on friendship than afew days alter the death of Africanus
(ξ 3), when Rome was still convulsed with the news and with
the dark suspicions which attached to it? This event took
place ina. c. 129, just after the celebration of the ‘feriae Latinae?
There had been a day ol great excitement in the senate, during

the brightest example.

Q. Mucius Scaevola, the augur, was an old man, Cicero, at the
age ol sixteen, was introduced to him by his father, in order that
he might imbibe a knowledge of law by listening to the answers
that he gave to his clients². The connexion thus begun con·
