ra, 55 9, 10). He displayed his philosophy also by'inventiug a chil-
dren's rattle (παταγή, Arist. Pol. VIII, 6, 5 a), to prevent their breaking
things in the house, as he recognised their inability to keep quiet.
Archytas Is supposed to have been born about mc. 400. His father's name
is variously given as Muesagoras or Hestiaeus (I). L. VIII, 5 79). He
was a friend and correspondent of Plato's. The ninth of Plato’s letters
is addressed to him, and contains avery striking passage. 'Diogenes
Laertius has also preserved two trivial letters, which were interchanged
between the philosophers. Cicero records (Cat. Mai. 5 41) that Plato
was at Tarentum with Archytas in the consulship of L. Camillus and
Ap. Claudius(13. c. 349). It was hyan embassy from Archytas and his
know-Pythagoream that Plato was rescued when he was in danger of
his life on his third visit to Syracuse, owing to the jealousy aud sus-
picion of the tyraut Dionysius (Plnt. Dion. ²03 cp. D. L. VIII, 5 79).
Aristoxenus the musician wrote a life of Archytas (Athen. XII, 545 a),
and Aristotle composed three books on his philosophy (D. L. V, 5 ²5)ss
We know from Horace (Carm. 1, 28), that he was drowned in the
Adriatic.

b. ab aliis senibus. That Laelius heard the saying at third hand
from Archytas is oi course onlya flight oi historical imagination on the
part oi Cicero, like that by thch Cato Maior in the De Senectute (5 41)
is connected by a chain os tradition with the same Archytas and with
Plato. But the thing is just possible as a matter of chronology. For
Laelius was born about Β. c. 186. Let us suppose that as a bey of ten
he heard the saying from an old man of eighty, who heard it seventy
years before from another old man of eighty. This second old man
would beten years old in Β. c. 336, when Archytas, who was born about
mc. 400, may easily have been alive. We have CIcero's word for it
(Cat. Mai. 541) that he was alive in n. c. 349.

c. naturamque mundi, &c The beauty of the universe was one of
the Stoic arguments for the existence of a divine mind. See De N. D.

dinemque rerum caelestium,’ &c.; De Div. II, 5 148—‘ et esse prae·
