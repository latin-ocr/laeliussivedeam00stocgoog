M. TULLII CICERONIS

clapse with ‘ne' above—‘ primurn, ne quid fictum sit3 deinde. . . re-
pel ere!

l. aliquid.. ‚ease molamm,⁴that some wrong hasbeen done to him!
566. a. condimentum amicitiae. For the metaphor cp. Cat. Mai.5 10
-‘ comitate condita gravitas! '

b. ille quidem. In this idiom the ⁸ illa' has no particular force, but
acts merely ns a kind of pad between ‘habet' and ‘quidem'

c. navitatem, ‘ impressiveness?

d. proclivior, ‘more inclined,' ‘prona' Cp. ‘proclivius ad per·
niciem,' 5 41.

567, a. unierit. ‘There presents itsell)

b. vetulis. 546 f.

c. teneros, i. e. young and supple.

d. homine. Not merely ol a man, but osa human being.

e. satietates. 569 a.

f. manissime, ‘ themellowest!

g. mulsos modios salis, &c.‚ ‘that many bushels oi salt should be
eaten together, in order that the work of lrlendship may be fulfilled)
‘Expletum sit’ here may be a true perfect, ‘may have been fulfilled:
but it would be superfluous to render it so in English. The proverb
quoted is from the Greek, Cp. E. N. VIII, 3, 5 8-2n δὲ προσδεῖται χρόνου
καὶ συνηθείας· κατὰ τὴν παροιμίαν γὰρ οὐκ ἔστιν εῐδῆσαι ἀλλήλους πρὶν
τοὺς λεγομένους ἅλας συναναλῶσοι.

ξ 68. a. herbis, ‘blades of com!

b. illae quidem. 566 b.

c. vetustas, ‘the old ,’ abstract sor concrete. ‘vetustas' which by it-
sclf would be rather harsh, is led up to by ‘novitates'; sor when a
word is used in the plural it has already lost somewhst of its strict
character as an abstract noun. Cp. 5 69 a.

d. Quin ipso equo. ‘Nay even in the case of the horse‚’ ‘ ipso equo'
is replaced later by the more definite ‘ eo quo!

c. quo consuevit. The ablative is due to an ellipse of ‘uti'

f montuosis etlam et silvestribus. The‘etiam’ herespeaksvolnmes
sor the change os sentiment with regard to nature between ancient and
modern times. Cicero in many passages, and especially in the De
Legibus, shows a keen sense ol the beauties of scenery: but it is the
amenities of nature, not her awlulness and sublimity‚ that attract him.

g. commorati sumus, ‘we have dwelt! Cp. Horace's ‘sub diro
moreris' (Carm. ΙΙ, 3, ²3)· The similar use in later Latin of ‘demorari'
gave rise to the F rench ‘demeuren’

§69¹ a. excellentiae. For other instances ol abstract nouns used in
the plural cp. ‘satietates' 567, ‘novitates' 5 68, ‘utilitates' 5 753
‘honestates’ Pro Mur. 5 87. Cp. 5 46 g.
