M. TULLII CICERONIS

Ιι. Aliter. This carries ns back to ‘Omnino amicitiae conroboratis
iam,' &a ‘Isto. . . aestimandi ' must be regarded as a parenthesis.

i. dispares enim morentiae. A cnriously ambiguous sentence.
Perhaps it is meant to be taken thus—‘ For a difference in tastes isa
consequence of difference in'character, and unlikeness in these (namely,
both character and tastes, cp. ‘morum studiorumque distantia’ below)
disserere friendships.’

j. quanta maxima potestesse. Cp. Livy XXII, 3, § 6-‘ quantam
maximam vastitatem potest, caedibus incendiisque consuli procul
ostendit.' For the position oi the superlative cp. ς 12.

§w a. intemperata quaedam benevolentia, ‘an intemperance of
affection, is Ι rnay be allowed the expression! The phrase suggests
some such Greek original as ἀκρασία τῆς φιλίας.

b. Neoptolemus. Neoptolemus, otherwise known as Pyrrhus, was ’
the son of Achilles (od. XI, 506). He was brought up on the island
oi Scyros (ll. XIX, 326), under the care of Lycomedes (Soph. Phil. 243).
Aiter his father's death Ulysses brought him from Scyros to Troy (Od.
XI, 509), because of a prophecy that Troy could not be taken without
him.

c. Lycomedem Lycomedes was king oi the Scyrians (Plnt. Thes.

d. nt discedendum sit. Consecutive clause—‘ so that one has to
leave? magnae is here constructed like ‘ tantae)

c. desiderium. §10 d. Here we may render it ‘the pain oi part-
ing,' bnt it means more precisely the pain that follows parting.

f. parum iustus, ‘hardly proper.' ‘Parum' serves as a weakened
kind oi negative, like ‘ minus.’ ·

§7st a. et quid postules, δια, ‘not only what you are asking from
your friend, bnt also what yon would allow him to obtain irorn you.'
‘Put yourself in his place,' appears to be the meaning.

b. dimittendis. ‘Dimittere ' is properly used oi voluntarily putting
a thing away irorn one. Cp. St. Augustine's ‘Te nemo amittit, nisi qui
dimittit' (cp. IV, 9).

c. oratio nostra, ‘our discourse.'

d. remissione usus, ‘ by an abatement os intimacy?

a. eluendae, ‘must be got rid οἱ) Lit. ‘washed away! Cp. our

phrase ‘to wash one's hands of.'

s. dissuendae magis quam discindendae. A homely and vigorous
metaphor, perhaps picked up out os some one oi the more than 150
speeches oi Cato's, which Cicero professed to have read (Brut. 565).

g. neo fieri possit. A periphrasis for ‘possible' The wantos
some equivalent ior the Greek δυνατός led to the invention oi ‘possi-
bilis' aiter the time oi Cicero. See Quint. III, 8, 925- ‘ δυνατόν, qnod
