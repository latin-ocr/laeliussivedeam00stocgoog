6 INTRODUCTION.

were suddenly to be blotted out. We should have lost, ¹to begin
, with, avery large part of the prose literature of Rome. But our
loss would not he merely one of quantity. We shouldbe without

what all after ages have agreed to recognise as the highest
achievements of human language. And then to think how great
would be our incidental and collateral loss! We should be de-
prived of our chief source of information on the early poetry of
Rome: for Cicero quotes Naevius aud Ennius and their suc·
cessors for their power or pathos, whereas subsequent writers
quote them chiefly for the sake of some archaic expression or

curiosity of construction. We should have lost our most original
authority on questions of early Roman law; we should have lost
a vast fund of historical anecdote and a most important contri-
bution to our knowledge of the Roman constitution ; we should
have lost also the secret history of one of the most critical
periods in the annals of the world¹3 and lastly we should have
lost the main source of our knowledge of Greek thought during
the three centuries after Aristotle

ξ 3. Cicero ar a philosopher.

lt is under this last aspect alone that we have now to speak of
the works of Cicero. We must remember that he figured to
after ages as the Roman Plato ². lt was he alone who en·
deavoured, as his great predecessor had done, to wed strength
of reason to beauty of style, and once more to make the dialogue
the vehicle of philosophical instruction. When he found that his
practical energies were being denied their scope by one of those
changes in the political order of things which his reading of Plato
had led him to expect ⁸, he threw himself heart and soul into the

sufficient discrimination. It was perhaps from this work that Macro·
hius extracted his chapter on the jokes of Cicero, Sat. 11, 3.

letters to Atticus (Life of Atticus, ch. 17).

² Lact. Div. Inst. 1, 15—‘M. Tullius, qui non tantum perfectus orator,
sed etiam philosophus fuit; siquidem solus exstitit Platonis imitator?

⁸ ‘Id enlm ipsum a Platone philosophiaque didiceram, naturales esse
quasdam conversiones rerum publicarum, ut eae turn a principibus tene-
rentur, tum a populis, aliquando a singulis.’-De Div. ll2 5 6.
