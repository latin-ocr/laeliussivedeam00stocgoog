etin primis Graccho molestus, quod indicat Gracchi in eum oratio, sicut
etiam in Gracchum Tuberonis!

c. 0. Blossius Cumanus. The Blossii were an old and distinguished
family oi Capua, who figured in the Second Punic War (Livy XXIII, y,
5 8, XXVII, 3 ; cp. De Leg. Agr. 11, 5 93). This C. BloasIus appears
to have been the chief friend and adviser ofTiberius Gracchus (see Plut.
Tib. Grac cha. 8, 17). He had been intimate with Antipater of Tarsus
and had been honoured by him with the dedication oi some oihis philo
sophical works. The story of his constancy in friendship is told, after
Cicero, by Val. Max. IV, 7, 5 1. Plutarch (ch. ac) puts the question
about the Capitol into the mouth of Nasica

d. hospes. 5 24 g.

ι. adaram . .in consilio, ‘assisting on committes! Cp. Brut. 5
86-‘ Cum consules re audita “ amplius '³ de consilii sententia pronun·
tiuvissent?

f. Laenati et Rupilio consulibua n. e. 13²· See 41 k odfin. and
ec· ·

g. si votrrtaret, paruissem. Plutarch adds a sentence which shows
the firm belief of Blossius in Gracchus* love for the people-'Aaa'
ἐκείνου γε προστάσσοντος, ἔφη, κάμοὶ τοῦτο πρᾶξαι καλῶς εἶχεν. ori γὰρ ἂν
Τιβέριος τοῦτο προσέταξεν, εὶ μὴ τῷ δήμῳ συνέφερεν.

Ιι. praefuit. He and Diophanes the rhetorician, an exile from
Mitylene, were credited with having prompted Tiberius to the course he
took. On the morning of the day which proved fatal to Tiberius, Blos-
sius encouraged him to despise anumber of bad omens, by which he was
at first inclined to be daunted (Plnt. Tib. Grac. 8).

i. oomItem. 5 96 ι.

j. Itaque hac amentia. ‘And so as a consequence of this madness’

The ablative ia to be taken with the whole sentence, and gives the ground
oi the iate which overtook Blossius.

k. quaestione nova A ‘quaestio nova’ was oue held under a
special commission, like that which was appointed to inquire into the
death of Clodius (Pro Mil. 5 13). Plutarch (Tib. Grac. ao) says that
some of the friends os Tiberius Gracchus were banished without trial,
others seized and put to death. This is probably the other way of stating
the same set of proceedings that are here implied by ‘quaestione nova'

l. ad hostis. To Aristonicus, on whose fall, in Β. c. 130, Blossius
committed suicide.

m. oum conciliatrix.. tuerit, ‘seeing that it was the impression of
vIrtue which brought about the friendship.’ ‘ ConcIIIatrix' is afavourite
word with Cicero, but he does not use the masculine ‘ conciliator.'

a. persam quidem, δια, ‘ii we were oi perfect wisdom indeed, the q 38,
thing might have no evil consequences.'
