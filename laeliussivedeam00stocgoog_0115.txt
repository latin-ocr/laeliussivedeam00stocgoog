nn AMICITIA. noras: 55 54-59.

b. nimis exigua et exiliter, δια, ‘ in too narrow andbeggarlyaspirit
to make friendship a matter oi reckoning, so that the account of receipts
and expenses may be balanced’ Livy also has the phrase ‘ad calculos
vocare' (V, 4, 5 7)—‘ si ad calculos eum respublica vocet) Cp. De Fin.
II, 5 6o—‘quidl sortes viri voluptatumne calculis subductis proelium
ineunt, sanguinem pro patria profunduutl‘ An account appears to
have been balanced by withdrawing thepebbles (‘ calculi ’)‚ which repre·
sented the items, from either side, until the two were even.

c. adfluentior. Cp. ‘adpetendus' 5 50. When participles lapse
into mere adjectives they become liable to comparison. In some parti-
ciples the adjectiva] nature basso triumphed that the verbal nature is
almost forgotteu, e. g. ‘sapiens‚’ ⁴ diligens' ‘neglegens’ in others the com·
parison causes more surprise. Thus iu De off. 1, 5 '76 we have ‘palen-
tiores ’ (=more obedient) and in ΙΙ, 5 71 ‘utentior’ (=with more com·
mand of money). ·

d. observare restricte. ‘to keep a niggard watch'

ι. ne quid excidat, &a Cp. Luke VI, 38-δίδστε, καὶ δοθήσεται
ὑμῖν· μέτρον καλόν, πεπιεσμένον σεσαλευμένον ὑπεμεκχυνόμενον, δώσουσιν
εἰς τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν.

f. congeratur. Friendship's measure should never lack a ‘ cumulus’
or ‘auctarium' ι

a. abiectior, ‘too desponding.’ Q 59,

b. amplificandae fortunae, ‘of advancing their position’

c. fractior, ‘too leeble.’ What was said above on the comparison of
participles applies to present and past participles. The comparison ol
the latter is much the more frequent.

d. eniti et efficere. A kind of hendiadys sor ‘strive with all one's
might'

e. ita amere oportere. Aristotle (Rhet. ΙΙ, 13, 5 4) says of old men
—Kul οὔτε φιλοῦσι σφόδρα οὔτε μισοῦσι διὰ ταῦτα, ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὴν Βίαντος
ὑποθήκην nal φιλοῦσιν ὡς μισήσοντες καὶ μισοῦσιν ὡς φιλήσοντες. Notice
here the vague use oi the infinitive without a subject τ ‘aliquem' may
be supplied mentally, as τινα oltenhas to be in Greek. Cp. ‘existimare
oportet’ in 5 61.

f si aliquando. ‘Aliquis’ and the words formed fremit are used
aiter ‘si' (in place of the more usual ‘quis' ‘quando’ &ol when
there is any stress meant to be laid upon the pronoun or adverb.
Cp. 5 tte-⁴ si aliquem'; Cat. Mai. 5 44-‘Sed si aliquid dandum est
voluptati!

g. quem ad modum putaretur. Aristode, as we have just seen,
quotes the saying as that of Bias3 but Aulus Gellius (I, 3, 5 30) ex-
pressly ascribes it to Chilon the Lacedaemoniun, and gives the wording
thus-⁸ Hac fini ames, tanquam sorte fortuna et murus, hac itidem tenus
