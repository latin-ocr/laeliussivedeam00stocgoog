M. TULLII CICERONIS

p. 168 d, VI p. ²74 c). also of an antobiography, which did not detract
from his credit (Tac. Agric. Ι), and of several speeches written in a
severe and meagre style. He had much practice as an advocate, but
was lacking in the grace and fire of the orator (Brut. ξ ΙΙο); he was
better as a jurisconsult, a function which he contrived to combine with
that of pleader (Brut. §5 113, 114). Rutilius became consul in B. c. 105.
Afterwards he served as legatus to Q. Mucius Scaevola (pontifex), when
the latter was proconsul iu Asia. In this capacity he incurred the
eumity of the equestriau order, who then exercised the judicia, by de·
sending the provincials against the exactions of the ‘ publicani) After
his return a charge of extortion (‘ de repetundis ’) was got up against him,
his accuser being the epicure Apicius, the first of that name (Athen. IV,
p. 168 d). This was so obviously a party move that the state was con-
vulsed with excitement. But Rutilius wrapped himself in his virtue, and
though he might have been defended by L. Crassus or M. Antonius, the
most celebrated orators of the day, he preferred to defend himself with
the cold logie of the Stoic philosophy, in which he was deeply versed,
having been a disciple of Panaetius. The result was his hauishment, of
which Seneca (De Ben. Vl, 37) says that there was no one who was not
more ashamed of it than himself. On his arrival iu Asia, to which he
retired, all the states of that province sentdeputations to meet him (Val.
Max. II, 10, ᾗ 5). After Sulla’s triumph he was recalled to his country,
but he then refused to leave Smyrna, of which he had been made a
citizen (Pro Balbo ξ ²8; Seu. De Prov. 3). Ovid allodes to this inci·
dent in his epistles ex Ponto (Ι, 3, 63, 64)-
‘Et grave magnanimi robur mirare Rutili,
Nou usi reditus conditione dati!

Cicero met him at Smyrna (Brut. ξ 85) when he visited Asia as a young
man after the delivery of the speech Pro Roscio Amerino.

k. A. Verginii. Of this person nothing more is known than the fact*
here recorded. The mention is perhaps a compliment to some friend of
Cicero’s youth.

l. ita ratio comparata est, &c., ‘our 'life and nature have been so
ordained.' ,

m. ex alia. These words have been supplied by Orelli to complete
the sense.

n. optandum. ξ ιι d.

commatibus. . . ad amcam. A metaphor from the chariot·
taces. The ‘carceres’ were the barriers within which the horses were
confined before starting: the ‘calx' was the line marked with lime
which served for the goal. Cp. Cat. Mai. ξ 83 adfine‘ nec vero velim
