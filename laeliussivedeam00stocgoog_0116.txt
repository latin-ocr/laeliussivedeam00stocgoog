M. TULLII CICERONIS

oderis, tanquam fortasse post amaturus? There can be no doubt about
the soundness of the latter part os the precept.

h. unueeseptem. §ye

i. ambitiosi, Using friendships as means to political advancemeut.

j. Quonam. . . modo. A stronger form ot ⁸ quomodo!

k. optare. §11 d.

l. ansaa Cp. ‘ pre-hendo.¹ We may render ,the word ‘bundles’z
bnt like the Greek λαβή it is probably a metaphor from the wrestling-
ring. Plat. Rep. 544 Β-ὥσπερ subaudierit αὐτὴν λαβὴν πάρεχε.

m. rursus autem, ‘while on the other hand.¹

ᾧ 60. a. illud, ‘the following! ·

b. praecipiundum fuit. Notice the unconditionsl statement See
§15c.

c. nt ne quando=‘ut nunquam) Notice that the second ‘ut’ is ol
consequence, the first of purpose.

dsiminus. §23k.

b 61. a. emendati, ‘free lronr saulis,' from ‘e' aud ‘mendum‚’ rather
than‘menda.’ ’ ’

b. si qus fortune. Perhaps ablative, not nominative.

c. minua iustae, ‘less proper.’

d. agatur, ‘is at state· Cp. Liv. XXVII, 34‚§ 7—‘ quum fama
eins ageretur!

e. est enim qautenus . ..possit 'A subjunctive of the same kind
as that after ⁴ sunt qui‚’ &c The sentiment is out ol keeping with that
of §40—‘turpis enim excusatio est‚' &a

f· quam blanditiis, &c., ‘though it is degrading to compass it by
fawning aud flattery) '

g. virtus, quam sequitur, &c The sentiment is somewhat ob-
scurely expressed. It amounts to saying that when affection can be
secured by right conduct, it is by no means to be despised.

§62 a. quod omuibus , ..essent ‘quod' gives the reason of the
feeling. The accusative with infinitive might have been used instead.
The sentiments here put into the mouth of Scipio are really those of
Socrates. See Xen. Mem. 11, 4, ἐξ 1, 2, 4.

b. dicere posse. We might supply ‘ quemque’ from ‘quisque,’

’ were it not for the ‘neglegentis’ below, which shows that ‘ homines’ is
the subject throughout

c. cuins generis, ‘a class os which'

§aa a. ut cursum. Supply ‘equorum' ‘Currum’ for ‘cursum’is a
tempting conjecture, but there seems to be no warrant for it

b. quo utamur, &c., ‘that we may test to some extent the characters

ot our friends before indulging in intimacy with them, just as we use

horses that have been tried’ Baiter's text has ‘ quo utamur quasi equis
