DE AMICITIA. noras? §druia

t. etiam nunc. Scipio was about fifty-six years ol age at the time
of his death in Β. c. 129.

a. moriundi. Cp. 5 60-‘praecipinndnm'; §62-‘experiundum' 3d 12.
5 76-ί faciunda'3 § 78—‘serundae'

b. quo do genera. Cp. De Inv. Ι, §5 ²9· 30; II, 5102, where ‘quo
de genere’ is used without a genitive depending on it. The collocation
is similar to ‘qnam ob rem,' which we have just had; ‘quem ad
modum,’ §5 16, 41 ad fin.'; ‘qua de re,’ De Inv. 1, 5 29.

· c. difficile dictu. Scipio was supposed to have been murdered.
In the evening he laid a tablet beside his bed on which he meant to
compose a speech to be delivered the next day; in the morning he was
found dead without a wound (Appian, Bell. Civ. I, 20). There were
said, however, to be marks oi strangling (¹ mane in lectulo repertus est
mortuus, ita ut quaedam elisarum faucium in cervice reperirentur notae‚’
Vell. Pat. ΙΙ, 4).

d. quid homines suspicentur. suspicion attached to C. Gracchus,
to his mother Cornelia, aud his sister Sempronia, who was wife to.
Affieanus (Liv. Epit. 593 Plut. Caius, 103 Appian, Bell. Civ. 20). The
more probable opinion, however, pointed to Fulvius Flaccus and
C. Papirius Carbo, who had been appointed triumvirs along with
C. Gracchus (in place os Tiberius and his father-inlaw Appius

ι Claudius), as the authors of the murder. It was said that some slaves
had consessed under torture that strangers had come in by a back-way
during the night and strangled Scipio. Carbo was charged with the
crime by the young orator Crassus. See De Or. ΙΙ, § 170, and cp. ad

Fam. IX, 21, ξ 3; ad Q. Frat. ΙΙ, 3, ς 3. Cicero himself entertained
no doubt but that there had been soul play in the matter. Cp. De
Fat. ἱ 18-‘ sic si diceretur “morietur noctu in cubiculo suo vi op·
pressus Scipio‚” vere diceretur; id enim iore diceretur, qnod esset
futurum, futurum autem fuisse, ex eo, quia sactum est intellegi
debet?

c. quos . . . celeberrimos. When a relative clause, such as ‘quos
in vita viderit' defines the limitation nuder which a superlative is to be
taken, the superlative naturally finds its place in the relative clause in
Latin. Not so in English: we should say something like this—‘ out os
the many days oi crowds and rejoicing!

fisociis et Latinis. The agrarian enactmcnts oi the Gracchi
affected injuriously the Italian allies os Rome; and it was Scipio's
championship of the latter, as against the Roman commons, that led to
his unpopularity and indirectly to his death.

g. ut ex tam alto, tac, ‘that from so lofty a pinnacle of dignity he
seems rather to have been translated to the gods above than to have Ι
descended to the shades below.’
