and was fond of speaking of his famous father-in·law ¹. What
more likely than that his thoughts would revert to him in 13. c.
88, when all the town was talking of the rupture of friendship
which had just taken place between one of the consuls of the
year, Q. Pompeius, and the great orator, P. Sulpicius Rufus, who
had recently obtainedthe tribuneship? Rome had good reason
to remember the severance of this friendship, for it was the pre-
cursor of the fatal feud between Marius and Sulla. The cir-
cumstances of the times therefore might be supposed to' lend a
special interest to the words of the old man and impress them
upon the mind of the youthful Cicero, who was one of the half-
circle of intimate friends, whom he addressed from his arm-
chair.

ξ 12. Tae Laelius a work os imagination.

Thus dexterously does Cicero sustain the illusion that the
words which follow are those of Laelius, and not of himself, so
dexterously indeed that his simple-hearted biographer Middle-
ton, whose mind was as wholly dominated by Cicero's as
Boswell’s was by Johnson’s, takes it all in good saith, and thinks
that the piece must needs ‘affect us more warmly’ when we find
that it exhibits ‘the real characters and sentiments of the best

, and greatest men of Rome! But we have no reason to suppose

that the sentiments are derived from any other source than those
Greek modeh, whom Cicero imitated. Cicero could make Cato
talk ‘more learnedly than he himself was wont‚’ and could put
into the mouth of a Catulus, a Lucullus and a Hortensius
metaphysical disputations which he himself admits they would
never have dreamed of uttering². No man's conversation,
however eminent he may be, is preserved for a period of
eighty-five years before it is committed to writing: but that is
the interval between the dramatic and the actual date of the
dialogue.
