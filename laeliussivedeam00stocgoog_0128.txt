Anton. ρο). He belonged to the derne of Colyttus, and his father's
name was Echecratides (Lucian, Timon, 7). He conceived a hatred for
mankind and shunned society, but made an exception in favour of Alci-
biades, because he foresaw that his career was charged with mischief to
the Athenians. He is referred to by Aristophanes in the Lysistrata

(808-15), where he Is graphically described as Ἐρινύος ἀπορρῶξι but
from the way in which he is spoken of we may infer that he had been
dead some time (sc, 411). In the Birds also (ae. 414) his name has
already passed into a proverb. Lucian has a dialogue on him, in which

“ his bitterness is ascribed to the ingratitude of the friends on whom he
had lavished his wealth. Shakespeare’s play is drawn, directly or in·
directly, partly from that and partly from the short description given
of Timon in Plutarch’s life of Antonius (ch. 70). The following is the
epitaph which he is said to have composed for himself-

ἐνθάδ’ ἀπορρήξας ψυχὴν βαρυδαίμονα κεῖμαι·
τοῦνομα δ’ οὐ πεύσεσθε, κακοὶ δὲ κακῶς ἀπόλοισθε.

Here lie 1, born to woe, .
And fraught with hate and gall.

My name ye shall not know.
A curse upon you all!

Apemantus (the ‘churlish philosopher' of Shakespeare)‚ who was some-

One day the pair were celebrating the Feast of Pitchers together.
Apemantus remarked how pleasant their banquet was. ‘lles,’ replied
Timon, ‘if you' were not here?

most distinguished philosophers of the Pythagorean school, and a deep
student of mathematica and mechanica He was also invincible as a

general, and held the supreme command over his countrymen seven
times, though the law only allowed of its being held once (Diog. Laert.
VIII, ἐξ 79, 82). In geometry he was the first to discover how to
double the cube (Ibid. ξ 83). ln proof of his mechanical ingenuity it is
recorded that he invented a wooden dove which could fly (Aul. Gell. X,
