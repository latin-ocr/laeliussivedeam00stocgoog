DE AMicrrrA. Nares: 551-3.

by a slave. The slave was rewarded by Sulla with his liberty, and then
flung down from the Tarpeian rock (Liv. Epist. 873 Plut. Sulla, 10).
We catch an utterance of the defeated party in the words of Cornificius
(Ad H. IV, 5 31)-‘ Sulpicio qui paulo ante omnia concedebant, eum
brevi spatio non modo vivere, sed etiarn sepeliri prohibuerunt.’

g. utebare. For ‘nti’ used of intimate acquaintance, cp. Pro Rosc.
Am. 527-ι qui pater usus erat plurimum? The abstract term ‘ usus‘ has
sometimes the same foroe, eg. 5 3²3 Pro Plancio, 5 5--‘in tanto usu
nostro tantaque amicitia! Cp. the use of ⁶ consuetudo: as in Livy XXV,
18, 5 4. Atticus’ cousin Anicia was married to M. Servius, the brother
of the orator Sulpicius.

b. capitali odio. The adjective ‘capitalis' is properly a legal term
signifying what affects a man’s life or status as a citizen. We have the
substantive ‘capital' in Livy XXIV, 37, 59, ‘Praesidio decedere apud
Romanos capital esse! From ‘capital' to ‘deadly’ the transitionis
easy. How deadly the hatred was between Sulpicius and Pompeius
may be gathered from the statementof Velleius Paterculus (II, 18) that
Sulpicius caused the murder of his former friend's son—‘Quin etiam
Q Pompeii filium, eundemque Sullae genemm, per emissarios factionis
suae interfecit! A less dark complexion howeveris put upon the act
by the account in Appian (Bell. Civ. l, 56)-ιιάν τῷδε Πομπηΐου τὸν
υἱόν, κηδεύοντα τῷ Σύλλᾳ, παρρησιαζόμενόν τι καὶ λέγοντα, κτείνουσιν οἱ
τοῦ Σουλπικίου στασιῶται.

τ’. Q.. Pompeio. Q. Pompeius Rufus was consul along with Sulla in
the year Β. c. 88. When Sulla was about to set out for the East, he was
appointed to the command of the army in Italy. But he was murdered
by the soldiers, with the connivance, it was supposed, of Cn. Pompeius
Strabo, the father of Pompeius Magnus. At all events Strabo quietly
resumed the command, which he had held before the arrival of Rufus
(Appian, B. C. I, 633 Vell. Pat II, ao, 5 1).

j. coniunctissime et amantissime. Cp. 5 104-‘ coniunctissimi
atque amantissimi viri? Ι

k. quanta esset, διο. ‘How much people wondered or lamented.‘
Perhaps we catch an echo of this quarrel in the rhetorical example given
by Cornificius (IV, 549)-‘mihi cum istu, iudices, fuit amicitia, sed
ista tamen amicitia—tametsi vereor, quomodo accepturi sitis, tamen
dicam-vos me privastis. quid ita? quia, ut vobis essem probatus, eum,
qui vos oppugnabat, inimicum quam amicum habere malui!

α. eam ipsam mentionem=‘eius ipsius rei mentionem.' Cp. Proh 3.
Mur. 5 68—‘ si tibi istam rationem non possim reddere,' where ‘istam
rationem'=⁴istius rei rationem.’

b. 0. Fannio. C. Fannius was older than Scaevola the augur, but
he married the younger daughter of Laelius. Following the example
