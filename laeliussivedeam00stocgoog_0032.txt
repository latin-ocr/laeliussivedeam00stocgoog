nificently treated by ‘the old Peripatetics and Academics¹.’
Among the Academics may perhaps be reckoned Simmias of
Thebes, one of whose twenty-three dialogues was entitled
περὶ φίλου ². Speusippus sister’s son to Plato, and who suc·
ceeded him in the Academy, left a treatise on friendship3
so also did Xenocrates, who succeeded Speusippus ³. Nor was
the subject let drop among the later school oi Stoies, for we find
mention of a περὶ φιλίας among the works of Cleanthes ⁴. That
Cicero was in some measure indebted to the Stoics would seem
probable from the coincidence of his own words in the Laelius
with language which he elsewhere attributes to them⁶. His
obligation to Xenophon is obvious, as he has taken the words of
Socrates in the Memorabilia and put thern into the mouth of
Scipio ⁸. But the chief source from which Cicero borrowed
seems to have been the lost treatise on friendship, in three
books ², by Theophrastus, who succeeded Aristotle as the head
of the Peripatetic school. This may be gathered from the
chapter of Aulus Gellius⁸, in which he complains that Cicero,
while freely imitating Theophrastus has not, like him, gone into
the casuistical question εἶ δεῖ βοηθεῖν τῴ φιἊῳ παρὰ τὸ δίκαιον καὶ
μέχρι πόσου καὶ ποῖα, but passed it over with the vague general-
isation in ξ 61, which ends with the words-‘ est enim quatenus
amicitiae dari venia possit’ lt was perhaps discreet ol Cicero
not to enter too minutely into this point. He was so good a
friend that principle with him sometimes went to the wall.
What his own practice in such cases was may best be given in
his own words-‘ Beneficium sequor, mihi crede, non causam, ut
in Milone, ut in—Sed haec hactenus ⁹.'
