Ι 5. His pln'losophical works, .

Another well-defined department of speculative inquiry, in
which Cicero combined theory with practice ¹, was politica!
philosophy. This subject had been amply dealt with by Plato

and Aristotle and Theophrastus Accordingly Cicero must · ³

have his treatment of it too. He had accomplished this design
’ as early as the year nc. 54, when, as he afterwards flattered
himself, he was still holding the helm of the state ². ln that
year we find him engaged on the arduous task-‘ spissum sane
opus et operosum' is his own description of it ³—of composing
his six books De Republica. But Plato, who was in all things
Cicero’s model, bad followed up his Republic at some later
date by a treatise on Laws. Cicero, therefore, at some later
period did the same, and composed his three 'books De
Legibus. This work, however, appears not to have been pub-
lished during the author’s lifetime. The Cato, which was ·
published tn Β. α 46, and answered by Caesario his Anticato⁴,

is reckoned by Cicero among his philosophical works, as being
philosophy teaching by example⁶ . Along with rt, as belonging
to the hortatory species of composition, we may class the Con-
solatio and the Hortensius, both published in Β. c. 45, and both
unfortunately lost. In the former he sought to soothe his
sorrow for the death of his daughter Tulliat, by applying the
consolations of philosophy ; the latter was an exhortation to the

study of the subject. To the power of this last work we bave -

the enthusiastic testimony of St. Augustine, to¹ whose spiritual
nature it gave the first impulse ². These three may be said to
