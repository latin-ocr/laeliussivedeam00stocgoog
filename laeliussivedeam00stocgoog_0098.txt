M. TULLII CICERONIS

‘Ambigitur quoties, uter utro sit prior, aufert

Pacuvius docti famam senis, Accius alti’
is confirmed by Quintilian (X, 1, ᾖ 97). The style of Pacuvius is con-
demned by Cicero (Brut. θ 258); and he had evidently gone out of

iashion by the time of Persius (see 1, 77). ln his old age he retired
from Rome to end his days at Tarentum. There is a pleasant story
told by Aulus Gellius (XIII, π) os how he received a visit there from
Accius, who was on his way to Asia. Accius read to him his tragedy
oi Atreus. The veteran poet pronounced the performance to be sound-
ing and sublime, but a little crude. Accius good humouredly accepted
the criticum, but hoped to improve with time, remarking that fraus
which began by being harsh ended by having a fine flavour, whereas
those that were luscious to start with soon went rotten. Aulus Gellius
(1, 24, § 4) has also preserved to us the modest epitaph, which Pacuvius
is said to have composed for himself- -
‘Adulescens, tametsi properas, te hoc saxum rogat
Ut sese aspicias, deinde quod scriptum est legas.
Hic sunt poetae Pacuvii Marci sita
Ossa. Hoc volebam nescius ne esses. Vale.¹
i. nova fabula. The Dulorestes‚ one of the most celebrated of the
tragedies of Pacuvius. It was a free adaptation from the iphigenia in
Tauris os Euripides. It appears still to have held the stage in the time
of Cicero himself. Cp. De Fin. V, 5 63-‘qui clamores volgi atque
inperitorum excitantur in theatris oum illa dicuntur:
ego sum Orestes;
contraque ab altero:
immo enimvero ego sum, inquam, Orestes!
cum autem etiarn exitus ab utroque datur' (a way out oi the difficulty is
offered by both) ‘conturbato errantique regi, “ ambo ergo una necarier
precamur,'’ quotiens hoc agitur, ecquandone nisi admirationibus maxi·
misl’ There is nothing exactly corresponding to this scene in the
Iphigenia in Tauris oi Euripides.
j. Stantes plaudebant. ‘They rose and elapped their hands!
lv. quod faeere ipsi, &o Cp. Cat. Mai. ς 64-‘ Athenienses seire
quae recta essent, sed iacere nolle‚’ said by one of the Lacedaemonium
ambassadors when the Atheniens applauded them in the theatra ior

showing a respect ior old age which they had failed to exhibit
themselves.

l. Hactenus. §55 g.

m. si qua praeterea sunt. ‘Anything that there is further!

n. si videbitur=‘ si placet’ (5 36), ‘if you please!

0. quitata disputant. See 5 17 c. .

p. quaeritate. §1oc.
