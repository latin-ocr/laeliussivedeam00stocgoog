M. TULLII CICERONIS

i. Satiserat. §15c.

ᾧ 99. a. blanda ista vanitas, ‘those solt nothings.'

b. excors. Notice that the heart was often regarded as the scat of
the intellect. T. D. 1. ς 18-‘aliis cor ipsum animus videtur, ex quo
excordes, vaecordes concordesque dicuntur et Nasica ille prudens bis
consul Corculum et

egregie cordatus homo catus Aelius Sextus!
The inclusion ol ⁸ concordes‘ does not to us seem appropriate, but ‘ con-
cordia' probably suggested ὁμόνοια to Cicero.

c. etiam adversando saepe adsentator. See the historical instance

· in Tac. Anu. Ι, 8, on which Tacitus remarks ‘ea sola species adulandi
supererat.'

d. det manus, ‘surrenders‚' a metaphor from giving the hands· to be
bound.

e. is, qui inlusus sit, ‘his dupe.¹

fi plus vidisse, ‘to have been eleuter-sighted.’ Sidgwick.

g. utin Entelero. These words are omitted by Baiter without
remark.

Ιι, Ut me hodia, &c The lines are from ‘The Heiress' olCaecilius
Cp. Cat. Mart 36.

i. comicos, ‘in the comedy.' Cp. Pro Rosc. Am. § 47-‘ comicum
adulescentem! ‘Tragicus‘ is used in the same way in Horace, De Arte ἶ
Poet. . ¹

j. tigranis atque, &c.‚ ‘knoblred rne about and made game of me
in the finest fashion.'

k. inlusoris. Baiter has ‘inlusserisf which was no doubt the way in i
which Cicero wrote it. Quintilian, who could still see the autographs os
Cicero and Vergil, tells us (I, 7, ς ro) that they habituallydoubled the s
alter a long vowel, as ‘ caussae, cassus, divissiones.'

hmo, a. stultissima persona,&c. Cp. Cat. Marino-‘Nam quos ait i
⁸ Caecilius “comicos stultos senes‚'’ hoc significat credulos, obliviosos
dissolutos?

b. inhominem eadere. Cp.§480. i
c. concludamus. Showing that the ‘conclusio’ or peroration is
now coming. ¹
d. cumseextulit. Ametaphor from the rising osastar.

ι. sive. . . sive, ‘call it which you wilt’

finihlleetaliud nisi. Acommon way of expressing the coexten- ¹
sion ol subject and predicate in a definition. Cp. the definition of friend-
shipintao.

g. diligere quem amsa. Not a very good definition since it uses
twice over the idea sought to be defined.

h. ecflorescit ex amicitia„ Thus utility bears somewhat the same
