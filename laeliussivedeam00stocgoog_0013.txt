’ HIS PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS. 9

constitute a trilogy of ἐπιτρεπτικοὶ λόγοι. The same year saw
the publication of the Academica in its twofold shape, and of
the De Finibus, , ln the first of these, which has come down to
us in a mutilated form, Cicero undertook the defence of that
school of philosophy to which he had devoted himself from his
boyhood ¹, regarding it as a retum from dogmatism to the modest

unassumingness of Socrates¹²; in the second he lets all the ,

schools have their! say and countersay ort the capital question
of the end of life. As a fitting pendant to these more strictly
philosophical works we have the charming Tusculanae Dis-
putationes, published in the next year (B. c. 44), in which Cicero
in his own person lectures on the eternal themes of the con-
tempt of death, the endurance of pain, the alleviation of sorrow,
the control of the passions, and the all-sufficiency'of virtue to a

. ‘happy life. These three treatises were followed by another

well-defined trilogy on theological subjects-the De Natura
Deorum, the De Divinatione, and the De Fato, all published in
the same year, Β. c, 44. lt might seem by this time that there
was nothing left to write upon: but the fecundity of Cicero was
not thus to be checked. The public of Rome were immediately
presented with another trilogy on outlying subjects of philo·
sophy. This consisted of the Cato Maior or De Senectute, the
Laelius or De Amicitia, and the lost De Gloria, which were also« ·
published in Β. c. 44. Before the close of the same year of
stupendous literary activity there appeared the De Officiis, the
last, and in some respects the greatest, of Cicero’s larger philo-
sophical works, which was composed amid all the distractions
of his contest with Antony. lt was not, however, absolutely his
last effort in philosophy. That was the Topica, which has been
already spoken of z so that Cicero’s career as a philosophical

coeperam ut ad te redirem! He¹ goes on to say that the merit ol the
boolr lay in the fact that it did not exhort oue to embrace the tenets of
this or that sect, but to follow trnth for its own sake. Yet he is un-
, grateful enough to say of Cicero-‘ cuius linguam fere omnes mirantur,

pectus non ita'
