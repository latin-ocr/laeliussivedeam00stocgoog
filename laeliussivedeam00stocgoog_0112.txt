M. TULLII CICERONIS

clause for the accusative with infinitive‚ as we have just had an accusa·

tive with infinitiva preceding.

c. quasi propinquitate . . . atque natura, ‘by a kind of natural ·
affinity.'

d. adpetentium. See 5 58 c.

e. bonis inter bonor. More definitely ‘reciprocal' than ‘bonis

inter se! =

f. benevolentiam, qui . . . fons. This kind oi attraction is thc
rule rather than the exceptionin Latin. Cp. Phil. 11, 5 44-· Pompeium,
quod imperii populi Romani decus ac lumen fuit’

g. inmunis, ‘unsocial’ the opposite oi ‘communis' 5 65.

h. quae . . . soleat, ‘seeing that it is wout’

p 51, a, tinguant, ‘manufactum' with the suggestion that the article is
spurious. From this use it was easy for the word to pass into our mean·
ing oi ‘fcigm' .

b, tumque. ‘ Tum' here may be rendered ‘only’

c. tantumque abest ut. . . ut, ‘and so far from friendships being
cultivated cn account oi want, those are the most liberal,’ &c The nse
of two ‘ut’ clauses makes this idiom rather heavy: sometimes a simple
indicative is substituted ior the second. Brut. 5 278-‘ itaque tantum
afuit, ut inflammares nostros animos,somnum . . . vix tenebamus?

d. opibus ct copiis. 5 22 e. The distinction between the two ideas
is brought out in De Rep. v, 5 8-ι opibus firma, copiis locuples!

ι. in qua plurimum ert praesidii. Cp. Apol. 30 Β-οὒκ ἐκ χρημά-
των ἀρετὴ γίγνεται, ἀλλ’ ἐξ ἀρετῆς χρήματα. See 5 30 b.

f. haud sciam an, &c ‘i might doubt whether it is even necessary
sor friends to be altogether above wants’ See 5 ro fl

g. neo domi neo militiae. §15s.

ᾧ 52. a. deliciis diffluentes. ‘Lapped in luxury‚' lit. ‘dissolving from de·
lights,’ as though their moral nature were going all to pieces under the
intluence of pleasure.

b. neo usu nec ratione ‘neither in practice nor in theory.¹

c. hebent cognitam. With ‘cognitum habere’ cp. ‘compertum ex-
ploratum haberc‚' ‘collectum habere' (De Div. II, §145): ‘coactum
habebat,' Cacsar, B. G. 1, 15 ; ‘redempta habere‚’ Ibid. 18. From such
forms we can see how ‘habere ’ was ready to lend itself on the break-up
os the language to use as a mere auxiliary. But in these classical usages
it is always more than a mere auxiliary. For instance, in Brut. 5 47.
‘habuisse conscripta' means ‘had written out and kept,’ which is a
great deal more than could be conveyed merely by ‘conscripsisse'

d. ut, ‘on condition that?

a. neque diligat quemquam, &c Juvenal may possibly have had
this in mind when he wrote (XII, 13⁰)-
