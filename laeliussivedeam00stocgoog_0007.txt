PREFACE

—ss—

ln· preparing this edition of the Laelius 1 have had in
view the wants ol a University student, who may be supposed
to take an intelligent interest, not only in the grammatical,
but in the literary‚ historical, and philosophical aspects ol
the books he reads. Baiter's text has been followed, with
a few variations which have been mentioned in the notes.
“f The idea ol uniting in one table the pedigrees of the
’” Aemilii Pauli and Scipiones is derived from Mr. Sidgwick’s
edition of this dialogue ; so also are a‘sew apt renderings,
.'. which are acknowledged in their place. Beyond this l
have no obligations to record to my predecessors‚ having
‘l thought that the attempt ata fresh treatment was the best

χ justification lor editing an already well edited book.

My thanks are due to Mr. Evelyn Abbott for his inde-
fatigable labour in revisi0n3 to Mr. A. C. Clark, Fellow
ol Queen’s College, lor having sent me the prool-sheets
of his valuable recension of the Harleian MS.; and to
Mr. Christopher Phillips, Scholar ol Brasenose, who was
kind enough to arrange the Index 'to the Notes.
