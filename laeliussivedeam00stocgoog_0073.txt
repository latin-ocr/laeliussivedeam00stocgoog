j. prudentia doctior. What is ‘prudentia’ in the mind in which it
originates becomes ‘doctrina' when transmitted to another. The specially
Roman meaning of ‘prudentia’ namely, au aptitude for law, is still testi·
fred to by our word ‘jurisprudenca' In the De Naturt Deorum 11, 5 58
Cicero shows himself acquainted wilh the fact that ‘prudentia' is a con·
tracted form of‘ providentia‚' offering it as an alternative for that word in
translating the Greek πρόνοια; cp. De Rep. VI‚5 r. In his juvenile
work the De Inventione (11, 5 160), he subordinates ‘providentia' to
‘prudentia' as ‘species' to ‘genus’ ‘Prudentia est rerum bonarum et
malarum neutrarumque scientia; partes eius memoria, intellegentia. pro·
videntia?

k. pontificem Scaevolam. Q. Mucius Scaevola pontifex, Publii
filius, was one of the chief founders of Roman law, and as such has had
his share ln the making of history. He codified the ‘ius civile' in
,eighteen books (Digest Ι, ii, π, 5 41). His father before him had ex-
celled in the same study (De Off. Ι, 5 116). He was raised to the
consulship in inc. 95 along with the celebrated orator L. LIcinius
Crassus. Cicero (De Off. III, 5 62) recounts a striking instance of his
personal probity. On being shown a farm, for the purchase of which
he was in treaty, he said that it was valned too low, and added roo,ooo
sesterces to the price. His administration of the province of Asia was
marked by such integrity and firmness that by a decree of the Senate
Scaevola was held up as a pattern to all future governors of that pro·
vince (Val. Max. VIII, 15, 56). As a speaker he was unrivalled in
the lucid interpretation of law, though otherwise more formidable as a
critic than admirable as an orator (Brut. 5 146). In the civil dissen-
sions he was a moderate adherent of the aristocratic side, and in favour
of effecting a compromise between the two parties (Pro Rosc. Am.
5 33). Nevertheless au attempt was made on his life by C. Fimbria, a
Marian leader‚ and the most reckless man of his day. F our years later
he was actually murdered In the consulship of the younger Marius (inc.
82), when Sulla’s army was already at the gates of Rome. 'Ihe image
of Vesta was sprinkled with his blood (De Orat. ΙΠ,5 10), and his
body was thrown into the river (Appiam Bell. Civ. 1, 88). Lucan (11,
126) refers to his death in these words—

‘Te quoque neglectum violatae, Scaevola, dextrae

Ante ipsum penetrale Deae, semperque calentes
Mactavere focos’

l. unum .. . praestantissimum. The exclusive force of the super-
lative is increased by the addition of ‘unus’ Cp. Verg. Aen. 11, 426-

‘ justissimus unus
Qui fuit in Teucris et servantissimus aequi!
