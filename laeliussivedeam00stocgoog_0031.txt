EARLIER WRITERS ΟΝ FRIENDSHIP. 27

is highly tinged by the Lysis of Plato. There are agreat many
ideas in this work, which reappear in the Laelius of Cicero,
such, for instance, as that true friendship is only possible among
the good ¹, that the good do not ask for base compliance from
their friends or render it to them ¹, that one’s feeling towards

whole impression left upon the mind is that Cicero has not
borrowed directly from Aristotle. Some of these resemblances
are accidental; in others the ideas have filtered down to our
author through other channels. Cicero's reading was confined
almost entirely to the exoteric works of Aristode, and the
