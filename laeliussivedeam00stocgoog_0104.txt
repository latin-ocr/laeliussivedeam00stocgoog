M. TULLII CICERONIS

the leadership of Attius aud Coriolanus the Volscians were com-
pletely triumphant, aud advanced as far as the ‘fossae Cluniae?
within five miles of Rome. The commons of Rome were unwilling
to fight. Ambassadors and priests were sent in vain to Coriolanus.
strength the matrons of Rome went out to him, and the expostula·
tions ot his mother Veturia and his wife Volumnia induced him to
withdraw his forces. So the story runs as told by Li'vy (II, 33-40).
He does not explain how Attius Tullius consented to surrender the
fruits of victory.
c. Viscellinum. Viscellinns or Vecellinus was the cognomen of
Spurius Cassius. See § 28 f

§32 a. 'I'iberium quidem Gracchum. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus
came of the noblest blood in Rome. He was son of the Tiberius
Gracchus spoken ofin 5 101 and of comella, the daughter of Africanus
Maior. As tribune in Β. e. 133 he endeavoured to carry out a scheme
of reform, which included the enforcement of the Licinian laud·
law and the extension of the franchise to the Italians (Vell. Pat. 11, 2,
5 3). To effect his purpose he had to depose his colleagne M. Octavius
Caecina, and to get himself re-elected for the following year. His career
was cut short by his cousin, P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio, who
headed an attaek upon him while he was addressing a popular meeting.
Arming themselves with fragments of the benches the aristocrats drove
their opponents down the slope of the Capitol, and slew Tiberius Grac-
chus himself along with many of his followers. 'lhe following is the
character given of him by Velleius Paterculus, who disapproved of his
politics-

‘Vir alioqui vita innocentissimus, ingenio florentissimus,
proposito sanctissimus, tantis denique adornatus virtutibus,
quantas perfecta et natura et industria mortalis conditio recipit!

b. Q. Tuberone. Cp. § 101. Q. Aelius Tubero was the grandson
of Paulus Aemilius, the conqueror of Macedonia, through his daughter,
Aemilia; and was thus sister's son to Africanus Minor (Brut.§ 1173
Pro Mur. 55 75, 76). He was a good lawyer (Aul. Gell. Ι, 22 , 5 7), and
was deeply read in the Stoic philosophy. His life was one os strict in·
tegrity, but his character was harsh, stem and repellent, so that he was
never a popular favourite (Cp. Tac. Anu. XVI, aa). He lost the prae-
torship through his parsimony on the occasion of a public banquet
given in honour of his uncle Africanus. Panaetius dedicated to him a
treatise ‘De Dolore Patiendo' (De Fin. IV, 5 s3l and his disciple,
Hecato of Rhodes one ‘De Officiis' (De Off. III, 5 63). Like most of
the Stoica, both Greek and Roman, he was strong in logie but weak in
rhetoric. Cicero says of him in the Brutus-⁴ fuit autem'coustaus civis
