4ι. Ρ. Nasicam. It appears hom Brutus‚§ 79, that this was P.
Cornelius Scipio Nasica, sumamed Corculum on account of his know·
ledge of civil law (T. D. 1, ς 18). He was the son 01 the man who was
selected to receive the Idaean mother ou her arrival at Ostia from
Phrygia, and the father 01 Serapio, the murderer 01 Tiberius Gracchus.
He was elected consul for the first time in rae. 162 along with C.
Figulus, but they were obliged to resign on account 01 a flaw in the
auspices (N. D. II, § 10). Hissecoud consulshipwas in Β. c. 155. He
was censorin lae. 159 along with M. Popilius Laenas. They saw a
very fat man on a very lean horse, and asked him why he was so much
better kept than his beast. ‘Because ' he replied, ‘I look after myself,
whereas that good-for-nothing Statius looks after the horse.' The
wag was promptly degraded for this untimely facetiousness (Aul. Gell.
1v,20‚s 11).

d. ut. Gracchum. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, the father 01
Tiberius and Caius, aud himself one of the most distinguished of
Romans. Balbus in the De N. D. 11, ξ 11, is made to call him ‘vir
sapientissimus atque haud sciam an omniurn praestantissimus,' and
Plutarch remarks that the claims to fame 01 his censorship, his two con-
sulships (B. c. 177 aud 163) and his two triumphs were eclipsed by the
brilliancy 01 his virtue. Though an opponent 01 Africanus the elder,
he defended him when unjustly attached, and afterwards married his
daughter Cornelia. This lady, who is known to farne as ‘the mother
of the Gracchi,' was considerably younger than her husband, aud was
early left a widow with twelve children, 01 whom only three survived.
These were Tiberius and Caius, and a daughter Sempronia, who married
Africanus the younger, and was credited by some people with having
caused his death. There was extant in Cicero's time a speech in .
Greek, which the father Tiberius delivered to the Rhodians (Brut.
