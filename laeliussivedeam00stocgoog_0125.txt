b. in bestiisvoluoribue. With Baiter’s punctuation we must trans·
late thus, ‘in the lower animals, whether birds, fishes or beasts, whether
tame or wild? This involves taking ‘ bestia’ as a genus, including bird
andfish. 1t is possible however that we have two threefold divisions
of the lower animals (1) from the point of view of the clement in
which they live, into beasts, birds and fishes', (π) from the point of view
of their relation to man, into those that are tame bnt live in the fields,
like cows and sheep, those that live in the house, and those that ure wild.

c. id enim puriter, &c., ‘for this is ¹congenital to every li'ving crea·
ture! This is the first principle from which Cato Uticensis is made to
start in his exposition of the Stoic philosophy (De Fin. III, 5 16)-
‘“ Placet his,''' inquit, “‘quorum ratio mihi probatur, simulatque
natum sit animal—hinc enim est ordiendum—ipsum sibi conciliari et
commendari ad se conservandum et ad suum statum eaque, quae con—
servantia sunt eius status, diligenda, alienari autem ab interitu iisque
rebus, quae interitum videantur adferre.”'

d. animante. §49 a. ¹

c. requirent. This word implies a feeling of want, like ‘ desiderio ’
below, which we may render ‘yearning’ Cp. Shelley's ‘love's sweet

g. unum ex dnobus. μία ψυχή is quoted by Aristotle (E. N. IX, 8,

used of a moral resemblance.

b. stabilitos amicitiae. Cp, §5 62, 64 odfin.

fi neque quiequam umquam,&c. Cp. ξς 40, mand contrast ξ 61
-‘ minus iustae amicorum voluntates’

g. inter se. Less heavy than ‘ alter alterum.' The reversion of the
verbs to the plural is a natural consequence of the change of pronoun.

a. in iis perniciosus est error, ‘they are in deadly error.' ᾧ 83.

b. ubrunum. §35 b.

c. adiutrix. Since most abstract terms are feminine, and there is a
constant tendency to personify abstractions, these feminine forms of
‘ movable substantives' are of common occurrence in the philosophical
writings of Cicero. Cp. Ι 37 ad fin.-‘ conciliatrix amicitiae virtutis
