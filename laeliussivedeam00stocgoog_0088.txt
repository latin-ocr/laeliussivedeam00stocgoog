M. TULLII CICERONIS

Greek literature and a good speaker in his own language. See Brut. 5
108—⁴ L. Furius Philus perbene Latine loqui putabatur litteratiusque
qnam ceteri? He became consul in rac. 136.

c. Manilius SeeDeRep. I, 518adfin. .The praenomen 01111111-
lius is sometimes given as Marcus, sometimes as Manius He was one
ol the most eminent jurists of his time (De Orat. Ι, 5 212,111,5 1333
Brut. 5 108 ; De Rep. 111, 5 17). He is mentioned in the Digest(1, ii.
2, 5 39) along with Brutus and Publius Mucius Scaevola, who, like his
son Quintus, was ‘pontifex maximus,' as one ol the three founders ol civil
law. He was consul in rac. 149 at the beginning ol the Third Punic
War.

d. alii plures. To wit Q. Tubero (sister's son to Africanus), P.
Rutilius, the supposed narrator of the dialogue (De Rep. I, 5 17),
Laelius with his two sons-inlaW, C. Fannius and Q. Scaevola, and
Spurius Mummius. ⁴ ι

e. Scaevola.. De Rep.I,518. He and Fannius are described as

ι being at that time ‘iam aetate quaestorii'

f. de re publiea. The De Republica, which is one of the most im-
portant ol Cicero's works, has survived only in fragments, partly pre·
served in other writers, and partly published by Angelo Mai in 1822
lrom a palimpsest ol Augustine in the Vatican. It consiste ef a dis·
course on political philosophy supposed to have been held between
Africanus the younger and his friends during the leisnre of the leriae
Latinae in the year ne. 129. Cicero purports to have heard it from the
lips ol one of the persons present, namely, the exile Ρ. Rutilius Rufus
(5 101), when he visited Smyrna in 78 B.c., i. e. 51 years later. He was
accompanied on that occasion by the person, possibly Atticus, to whom
the treatise is addressed (De Rep. 1, 5 13).

g. quae se inquiete, &c This refers to the famons‘Somnium
Scipionis‚' which is Cicero’s equivalent for the vision ol Er, with which
Plato's Republic closes. When the younger Africanus was on a visit
to Masinissa in Africa, the elder is supposed to have appeared to him in
a vision, loretelling his destiny and expounding to him the mysteries of*
the universe. Macrobius has a long treatise on the ‘Somnium Scipionis:
which is a mine of curious learning.

h. ut. The clause with ‘nt' is explanatory ol ‘ita’ So in such phrases
ns ‘ mos est ut,' ⁸ consuetudo ut’ 5 17.

i. a custodia vinclisque eorporis. The idea ol the ‘shades of the .-
prison-housc' goes back to the Mysteries. See Phaedo 62 B-d . . .
ἐν ἀπορρήτοις λεγόμενος περὶ αὐτῶν λόγος ὡς ἕν τινι φρουρᾷ ἐσμὲν ol
ἅνθρωποι noi οὐ δεῖ δὴ ἑαυτὸν ἐκ ταύτης λύειν οὐδ’ ἀποδιδράσκειν. The
word φρουρά in this passage evidently means a prison. a sense which it
bears also in Gorg. 52 5 A, but it might mean ‘a watch·post,’ as might
