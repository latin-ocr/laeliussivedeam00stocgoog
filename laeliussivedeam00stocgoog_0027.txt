CHARACTERS OF SCIPIO AND LAELIUS. 23

hardly ever out 01 1115 hands ¹. Here he would get ele-
vated sentiments coupled with the very weakest 01 dialectic.
Panaetius has 1011 05 through Cicero the record of a highly

, Xenophontean utterance on the part 01 1115 distinguished pupilt.
But after all philosophy is a thing to be lived rather than to be
learnt, arrd we have the consentient testimony 01 all antiquity
to the fact that these two great men exemplified in their lives the
efficacy 01 their beliefs. Laelius, in addition to his studies in
philosophy, had the true philosophical temperament, the equa·
bility 01 demeanour and unchanging serenity 01 lace, which had
been noticed in Socrates, 01 whom his wife said that he always
looked the same when he came in as when 110 went out.
Laelius was a Stoic whom the teachings 011115 school had failed
to sour. For those to whom Cato seemed too stem Seneca
suggests Laelius as an example 01 1110 and as a moral guardian to
be kept continually before one’s thoughts ⁸. As for Africanus,
the accounts that we have 01 1115 magnanimity, 01 the modera-
1100 which led him in his censorship to discard the prayer for
the extension 01 1110 Roman empire, and substitute one forits
preservation ⁴, 01 1115 justice, liberality, and tilial affection ⁶, 01 his
simplicity 01 1110 and absence 01 personal ostentation⁶ are
enough to show that the lessons 01 Panaetius were not thrown
away upon his pupil. The admiration that was entertained by
the ancients for his character may be inferred from an expression
01 the Christian writer Lactantius ⁷—‘ Hercules, qui ob virtutem ,
clarissimus, et quasi Africanus inter deos habetur.’ lt was not
Africanus that was compared to Hercules, but Hercules that
was compared to Africanus!
