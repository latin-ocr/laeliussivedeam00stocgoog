BAYE OF THE LAELIUS. 11

De Fato, but before the De Officiis. The book itself contains
a reference (§ 4) to the companion treatise on Old Age, which,
like it, was addressed to Atticus. On the other hand the De
Officiis contains arelerence to the Laelius ¹. That it was written
alter the De Divinatione appears from the lact that in the
preface to the second book of that treatise Cicero gives us a list
ol his philosophical works, sofar as they had yet appeared, and
while anticipating the appearance of the De Fato says nothing ’
about the Laelius. Whether the Laelius was written before or
after the two books De Gloria cannot, so lar as I know, be
determined².

δ 8. Tille os the treatise.

The proper title ol the treatise is Laelius, not De Amicitia, as
it is so generally called. In proof ol this we may cite the words
ol Cicero himself in the De Officiis-‘ Sed de amicitia alio libro
dictum est, qui inscribitur Laelius,' or, if the genuineness of the
last clause be attacked, as it has been, we may fall back on Aulus
Gellius (XVII, 5, ᾗ 1), who says-‘ M. Cicero in dialogo, cui
titulus est Laelius vel de amicitia.' Cicero, alter the manner ol
Plato, sometimes named his dialogues alter one ol the principal
interlocutors. Thus his account of Roman oratory is named
Brutus ³, his treatise on old age is named Cato Maior⁴3 his ex-
hortation to philosophy is named Hortensius ⁶, being an answer
to that orator's disparagement of the subject; and the second
book of the earlier edition of the Academica is named Lucullus,
under which name itis sometimes cited. ‘De Amicitia' is the
sub-title of our dialogue, indicating the nature of the subject-
matter, just as the Brutus is called De Claris Oratoribus, the
Cato Maior De Senectute, the Consolatio De Luctu Minuendo ⁶,
