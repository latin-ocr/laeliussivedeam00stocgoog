From the idea of prayiug (see 5 11 d) it is an easy transition to that ol
something merely visionary or ideal. For the latter sense oi ‘ optare’ cp.

incorruptibility that the prisoners were released without ransom (Liv.
Epit. 5 13). Pyrrhus‘ admiration for Fabricius was raised still higher
when, in his second consulship in Β. e. 278, he seut back to the iring the

14). In his two consulships and in his censorship (n. c. 275) Fabricius
had the same colleague‚ Q. Aemilius Papus. They ejected from the
senate P. Cornelius Rufinus, whom Fabricius himself had helped to
attain his second consulship in n. e. 277, out os respect ior his military
