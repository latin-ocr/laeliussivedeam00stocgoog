10 INTRODUCTIOM'

writer ended, as it· began, with the technicalities of rhetoric.
Two minor workS, however, have still to be mentioned in this
context, the fragmentary translation of the Timaeus of Plato, ol
which we know from the preface that it was composed aster the
Academica, and the Paradoxa Stoicorum, a mere jeu d'esprit ¹,
written in Β. c. 46, some time after the Brutus and before the Cato.

§ 6. Fecundity eff Cicero's genius.

This brief review of Cicero’s philosophical writings has been
made with aview to assigning its proper position in the series
to the treatise with which we are specially concemed, namely,
the Laelius or De Amicitia: but we cannot make it without
marvelling at the prodigious, one might almost say, leverish¹
activity of our author. Cicero's genius was never dimmed by
age. During the greater part of his lile he was immersed in the
pursuits ol ambition and the requirements ol the lorum. It was
not till after the age ot fifty that he seriously began his career as
an author. With the exception of the De Inventione, which his
mature judgment discarded‚ all the works of which we have

witnessed the publication in rapid succession of the Tusculan
Disputations, the De Natura Deorum, the Cato Maior, the De
Divinatione, the De Fato, the Laelius, the De Gloria, the De
Officiis, and the Topica. Truly in this year Cicero wrote as if
he had an instinct that his time was short!
