SUPERIOR A TTRACTION OF THE LATER PAIR. 17

defect about the elder Africanus and the elder Laelius. They
were not literary. Even Cicero himself, who in his Brutus has
a kind word for everyone who had a tincture of learning or ever
,s spoke from a hustingS, can only say of this AfricanuS, ‘ipsum
Scipionem accepimus non infantem fuisse ¹? By any one accus-
tomed to such testimonials this reticenee must be accepted as
extremely damaging. Of Laelius in the same connexion he says
nothing at all, though Livy tells us that he had much influence
in the Senate 2. That age was too early for the combination of
Roman virtue with Greek culture, which alone would satisfy the
ideal of Cicero. But in the next generation the intluence of
Greek literature was already beginning to make itself felt. The

son of the elder Scipio left some speeches behind him and a
history very pleasantly written in Greek³. His health, however,
was too weak to allow him to play a part in politics Having no
son of his own, he adopted the second son of L. Aemilius Paulus,
whose victory over Perseus at Pydna had won him the title of
Macedonicus. The youth who now became by adoption the
son of Ρ. Scipio was at the same time his cousin by blood, since
the elder Africanus had married Aemilia, the sister of Mace·
donicus. On his transference from the Aemilian to the Cor-
nelian gens the son of Aemilius Paulus became P. Cornelius
Scipio Aemilianus, and he won for himself afterwards the
already inherited sumame of Africanus ⁴, to which the word,
‘minor' is usually added to distinguish him from his grand-
' father or uncle. The life-long friend of this Scipio was also a
C. Laelius, theson of the man of whom we have spoken. The
names of these two persons were more attractive to Cicero than
any other names in all the annals of his country⁶3 and the

under the name of Africanus the elder, but its genuineness was doubted.

from his use of pronouns. Cp. Brut. ξ 77—‘ is qui hunc minorem
