Ιι. 0. carbo. C. PapiriusCarbo was tribune in a. e. 131. He and
Fulvius Flaccus had been appointed triumvirs for carrying out the land
laws in the room of Tiberius Gracchus aud his father-in-law Appius
Claudius (Appian, Bell. Civ. 18). One of the bills which he proposed
was that it should be lawful for a tribune to be re-elected as often as he
pleased (cp. 596). During the discussion upon this measure Carbo
asked Scipio what he thought of the death of Tiberius Gracchus and
received the answer that he had been justly slain (Pro Mil. 5 83
Vell. Pat. 11, 4, 5 43 Livy, Epit. 59). After C. Gracchus had met his
death Carbo, who was consul in uc. 120, turned completely round,
and defended Opimius, who slew him, adopting the same language
which Africanus had used to him (De Orat. II, 5 106). His sudden
conversion did not inspire confidence in the minda oi the nobility (De
Leg. III, 5 35). They made no effert to save him when he was accused
by the rising orator Crassus, aud Carbo put an end to himself by swal-
lowing cantharides (Ad Fam. IX, 28, 53). Carbo wasone oi the
greatest orators of his time, though inferior to the age which followed
him. Cicero makes Crassus say (De Orat. 111, 5 28)-‘ profluens quid·
dam habuit Carbo et canorum ' : but describes him as ‘ignarum legum,
haesitantem in maiorum institutis, rudem in iure civili.' His speeches
were still read in the time of Cicero (Brut. 5 104).

i. 0. Cato. This C. Porcius Cato was more distinguished for his
ancestors than for his merita. He was grandson ofCato the Censor and
of Paulus Aemilius Macedonicus, and was sister's son to Africanus
minor. Aa consul in rac. 114 he was ignominiously defeated by the
Scordisci in Thrace (Eutrop. IV, 24). Afterwards he was condemned
for extortion in Macedonia. The paltry damages laid against him were
cited afterwards asa sign of the strictuess of the times (Cic. Ver. ii, III,
5 184, ii, IV, 5 ης Vell. Pat. II, 8, 5 1). Eventually his missortunes
seem to have driven him to become a citizen of Tarraco (Pro Balbo,
5 28). He is mentioned by Cicero with faint praise as a speaker (Brut.
5108).
