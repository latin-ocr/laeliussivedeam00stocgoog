THE YOUNGER SCIPIO. 19

by the verdict of the people, and, before two years were out,

Scipio was commanding in Africa as consul (110. 147). ln the '
next year he destroyed Carthage. This was the first great
triumph of his life. The second was the destruction of Nu-
mantia, which for ten years (lae. 143-133) had defied the arms
of Rome. He was elected consul in his absence ln ac. 134,
and the next year witnessed the fall of that city ¹. When he
returned to Rome a year later (Iac 132), it was to find the city
plunged in confusion over those popular reforms‚ which had
already eost the life of his cousin and brother-in·law Tiberius
Gracchus. Scipio had struck the keynote of his future policy‚
when he exclalmed at Numantia, on hearing the news,

When Carbo asked him before the people what he thought of the
death of his kinsman, he made the well-known reply, ‘iure eum
caesum viden',’ and met the clamours of the crowd with· the
scornful exclamation, ‘Taceant, quibus ltalia noverca est³!' ,
These things lost him the favour of the people, and he himself
threw all the weight of his influence into the cause of the Senate.
Cicero suggests that he might have been appointed dictator to
quell the disturbances, if his life had been prolonged ⁴. The
manner of hisdeath at the age of 56 has been already related.

ξ 16. The younger Laelius.

The career of Laelius as a man of action was completely out-
. shone bythat of his illustrious friend. Born about a year before
Africanus, Laelius attained the praetorship in B.c. 145, and the
consulship five years later ⁶, after being rejected the year before
in favour of Q. Pompeius ⁰. As a general he acquitted himself
creditably in his campaign against Viriathus iu which he broke
the power of that prince of bandits ⁷. Plutarch says that in the
