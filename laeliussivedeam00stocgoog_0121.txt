practically equivalent to ‘ moreover.’

b. conroboratis iam, &c ‘Only when both character and age have

· The garne of hall is probably a good deal older than Nausicaa (Hom.

Od. V, 100). Maecenas was equal to it after a journey, while Horace
and Vergil were not (Hor. Sat. I, 5, 48)—

‘lusum it Maecenas,- dormitum ego Vergiliusque3

namque pila lippis inimicum et ludere crudis'
The diminutive is used bySt. Augustine among the emblems of child-
hood (Conf. I,ch. 19 ad fin.)-‘a nucibus et pilulis et passeribus'ad
praefectos et reges’

e. eos babere necessarios. ‘Oportet’ has to be supplied from
‘indicandae’ This is a rare construction in Latin, but we seem to
havea parallel to itin Livy XXVI, 32, 5 ις XXVII, ιο, 55 6, 7. It is
more common in Greek. Take for instance Plat. Crito 51 C-rral
πανταχοῦ ποιητέον d dv κελεύῃ ι) πόλις real ἡ πατρίς, ἢ πείθειν αὐτήν,
where the πείθειν is governed by the δεῖ latent in ποιητέον.

s. paedagogi. Tha παιδαγωγός was the slave who had the careus
children. Thus the παιδογονγόε, who figures in the Medea of Euripides,
is addressed as

τέκνοιν ὀπαδὲ πρέσβυ τῶν Ἰάσονος

(line 53, Dindorf).

It was the duty os the παιδαγωγός to conduct his young master to and
from school (Plat. Lysis, 208 Ε). In the Lysis of Plato the παιδαγωγοί
are represented (aa 3 A) as pouncing down upon the boys, like duennas,
and carrying them off to the detrimeut ol the dialogue. In the Phormio
ol Terence (line 144) Phaedria is jocularly calleda ‘paedagogus¹ because
he escorted agirl to and from her music-lessons. The word has given
riseto our‘page' on the one hand and ‘pedagogne' on the other: its
meaning may be said to lie between the two.

g. aestimandi. The MSS. here have simply ‘est‚' for which
Mommsen conjectured ‘aestimaudi'
