d. unuh. ‘Tenuis' is regularly used in the sense of ‘poor' and

the same topic again (ΙΙ, 5 30), he substitutes ⁴ pauper! For ‘tenuitas'
cp. De Div. Ι, 5 92, where we are told that the sons os leading men at

last member of the division ought to be ‘ ii, qui snum negotium gerunt
otiosi} as being the residual head under which any kind oi life, which
has not had a special name assigned to it, may be thrown. For either
you go in sor politice or not; if you do not go in so'r polines, either you
