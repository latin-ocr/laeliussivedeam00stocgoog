nn Auroram. noras: §t 3-5.

agatur res, nou quasi narretur! Itis possible that Cicero had before
his' mind the passage in the Theaetetus (143 c), in which Plato declares
in favour of the dramatic form of dialogue: but the marks ol imitation
are not conclusive.

f. interponeretur. It is habitual with Cicero to use the historic
sequence after a true perfect like ‘induxi'

a. mecum meres, nt, ‘you pleaded with me that’ Cp. Pro Mur.§ 4,
ς 3²-‘ neque vero cum P. Africano senatus egisset, ut legatus fratri
proficisceretur'

b. digna . . . omnium cognitione, ‘one of general interest?

c. teci non invitus ut, ‘I was not unwilling to.’ Au idiomatic
periphrasis of common occurrence. Cp. Cat. Mai. ς 4a-‘ invitus ieci
ut . . . L. Flamininum e senatu eicerem.'

d. (tatone Matore. . . de senectute. Here Cicero himself iudi-
cates the correct title and sub-title ol the earlierldialogue composed in
this the'most active year of his literary lile, uc. 44.

e. Catonern Cp. §5 5, 6, 9, 11, ar‚9o, 101.

f. aptior. . . quae. Like ‘dignus indignus, idoneus qui.¹

g. persona. Ἀ theatrical metaphor. The word means literally a
maslr (⁸ personae pallentis hiatum,'Jnv. III, 175), and then the character
or part played by a person ou the stage or off. Hence our word
‘person' by which the Latin term has sometimes tobe rendered. De
Orat. III, 5 53-ι ut rernm, ut personarum dignitates ferunt'

Ιν. eins, qui. . . minuet, ‘one who hsd been! The generie sense os
‘ one’ is imparted by the use ol the subjunctive.

i. maxime memorabilem. The comparative ‘memorabilior’ occurs
in Livy XXXVIII, 53, but the single iorm of the superlative is avoided,
doubtless as being too long. Cp. De Div. I, § 94-‘quod agros uber-
rimos maximeque fertiles incolunt?

j. disputata. There is no ‘dissertus' in Classical Latin: ‘Di-
sertus,’ which is said to stand sor it, is used only as au adjective.

k. ateorrun inlustrium. Cp. 5 7-‘ etcum quidem;' ξ 17—‘ eaque
Graecorum? -

a. ad senem senex de senectute, &c A good instance os a ligure§ 5.
os speech, which may be designated Paronymous Terms. Cp. 5 25-
‘ iustitiam iustissimo! One of the most sustained instances of it to be
found¹ anywbere is iu Plato, Prot. 3ι6Β-ὥσπερ ol γραμματιστώ ταῖς

μήπω δεινοῖς γράφειν τῶν παίδων ὑπογράψαντα γραμμὰς τῇ γραφίδι οὕτω
rd γραμματεῖον διδόασι.

b. septena. The distinction that is here implied between ‘sapiens'
aud ‘prudens‘ is brought out below. ‘Prudentia’ involves only
‘multarum rerum usus'; ‘sapientia' demands also ‘studium et doc-
trina ἰ the one is based on practice, the other superadds theory. ’
