THE ELDER SCIPIO AND LAELIUS. 15

Laelius, Cicem speaks of the authority that is imparted to a dis·
course by attaching to it the name of someancient and illustrious
person. tv ow there are no names in all the annals of Rome,
which are at once so great and so intimately intertwined as those
of Scipio and Laelium, and therefore none so well adapted to
serve the purpose of Cicero in connexion with this work.
It is a strange freak of chance that both in the second
and in the third Punic War there should have been a Scipio
and a Laelius, each pair united in the strictest bond of ’
friendship. The elder Scipio Africanus was an altogether
surprising. and phenomenal person, whom the efforts of
others as well as of himself have combined to raise above the
standard of common humanity. He first bursts upon usin the
pages of Livy at the battle of the Ticinus (lacn 218), where he
is said to have saved hisfather's life, though the historian knows
all the time that it wasa Ligurian slave who did so ¹. Then we
have him waving his sword over the head of Metellus and the
othe'r young nobles, when they were on the point of abandoning
their country in despair after the battle of Cannae (Β. c. 216) ².

Next we find him elected curule aedile (rae. 212) when under
full age, and cowing the opposition of the tribunes with the
remark that ‘ he was old enough to be aedile, if all the Quirites
thought him so ³3 All this before the age of twenty-four, at
which he was unanimously appointed to thecornmand in Spain
(rae. 211)⁴! Here he figures as a sort of Moses, before whom

the sea retreats to enable him to capture New Carthage
,(Β. c. 210) ⁵, and as a second Joseph, superior to all the passions
and pleasures of youth ⁶. His triumphant career in Spain is
followed by the romantio episode of his visit to Syphax in Africa,
where heis entertained at the same table with his enemy Has-
drubal, the son of Gisgo, and impresses even foes by his mar·
vellous affability and by the majesty of hIs presence ⁷. F inally
