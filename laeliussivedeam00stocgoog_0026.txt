22 INTRODUCTIOM

‘lenitas’ for Laelius l; and the same features were reflected in
their lives, as Horace has so happily put it—

virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli ¹.

And, again, we have Cicero saying in the De Officiis ³—‘ in '
C. Laelio multa hilaritas3 in eius familiari Scipione ambitio
maior, vita tristior) It may be imagined that two such
characters would happily blend with one another, like the strong
Falernian with honey in the Roman mead or ‘mulsum’ Their
mutual admiration formed a sound basis for friendship, which
is a commeree that requires give and take. Laelius worshipped
Scipio as a god because of his unsurpassed renown in war, while
Scipio revered his friend because he was a little older than
himself, and conceded to him the primacy in all the arts of
peace ⁴. Laelius is always spoken of as a perfect master of
philosophy, and it is to be presumed that he had gone deeper
into the subject than his friend. He studied first under Diogenes
the Stoic‚ who was seut to Rome from Athens on an embassy to
the senate in nc. 155, and afterwards under Panaetius³. Under
this second master at all events his friend shared his studies,
and he may have done so under the first. ln fact Panaetius lived
with Africanus ⁶, who wasone of the first to begin the practice,
which afterwards became so common among Roman magnates,
of keeping a philosopher, much as a private chaplain is kept in
the house oi an English nobleman. We may believe that the
paths of learning were rendered smooth for so great a pupil,
and that Africanus gently imbibed philosophy from the dis-

courses of his guest, instead of spending his days and nights
over it, like his nephew Tubero⁷. This suspicion is strengthened
when we learn that Xenophon was his favourite author, and
