f. eorum. The Pythagoreans, who dwelt in the eides of Magna
Graecia, and especially in Croton.

g. magnamque Graeciam. A name given to the Greek settlements
iu Sonthem Italy, just as we talk of ‘Greater Britain!

Ιι. institutis et praeceptis. The distinction between these corre·
sponds to that between ἔθος and λόγος or διδαχή, Arist. E. N. X,
9, s 6.

i. eius. Socrates. Cp. 5 7 f, §10-

j. sedidem semper. Supply ‘videbatur’ from below. Socrates,
which of conae means Plato, never argues in favour of any other view
than that of immortality, bnt he more than cuce admits that the survival
of death by the soul is after all an open question. Take for instance
Apol. 29 A, Β. .

k. reditum in caelum. The four elements were supposed to occupy
their places in the universe in order of comparative grossuess or purity-
earth, the heaviest, lowest, then water, then air, then fire. Any particle
of oue elemeut, if separated from the main body, always tended to return
to it. Hence a stoue falls down to earth, whereas fire bnms up to
heaven. Now the soul was evidently connected with tire—as witness
the heat of the body, which becomes cold at death, when deserted by
the sonl. Hence, when released from the body, it tended to rejoin the
celestial fires. This idea is nnconscionsly perpetuated whenever we talk
of ‘going np to heaven’ at death. See De Rep. VI, § 15-‘ iisqne (i. e.
hominibus) animus datus est ex illis sempiternis ignibus, quae sidera
et stellas vocatia'

a. quasi praesagiret. A reference to the idea that men become in· ᾧ 14.
stinct with the spirit of prophecy at the approach of death. See Apol.
39 C, Riddell's note, and the treatment of the subject put into the mouth
of Quintus Cicero in De Div. 1, 55 63-5, from which it will be sufficient
to extract the following passage bearing on the meaning of the word
‘praesagire Neque enirn illud verbnm temere consuetudo adprobavisset,
si ea res nulla esset omnino,

praesagibat animus frustra me ire, cum exirem domo.
[sagire enim sentire acute est, ex quo sagae anus, quia multa scire volunt,
et sagaces dicti canes: is igitur, qui ante sagit quarn oblata res est,
dicitur praesagire, id est futura ante sentire].'

b.Phi1ua. See De Rep. Ι, 5 17. L. Furius Philus was anintimate
friend of Scipio and Laelius, and celebrated like them for his upright·
neas and moderation. Cicero often mentions him in the same breath
with his two more famous compeers, e. g. De Orat. 11, §1543Pro
Archia 5 16; De Leg. Agr. lI, 5 64. He was an ardent student of
