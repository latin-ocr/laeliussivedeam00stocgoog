M. TULLII CICERONIS

with much the same feeling as Caesar. He was in the habit ol thinking
certain things to be ‘inconsistent with the dignity of himself and the
Roman people.’

ᾧ 70. a. ut . . . impertiant, ‘namely that . . . they should impart'

b. ee, ‘the results,’ a vague nse of the pronoun. The ‘praestantia
virtutis, ingenii' is itsell incommunicable.

c. nt, si. Ut is a hard-worked particle. We havc just had ‘ut' epexe-
getical, we havenow ‘ut' consecutive, and in the next clause we have ‘ ut’
comparative. .

d. in fabulis, ‘in romanoe! In Greek it would be ἓν μύθοις.

ι. pastores, quos potres. Asin the story ol Romulus and Remus,
who were brought up by the shepherd Faustulus and his wife Larentia
(Livy 1, 5), and in that ol Cyrus the Elder, who was reared by the
βούκολος Μιτραδάτης and his wile Σπακώ (Hdt. I, 110).

s. certis, ‘undoubted’ Cp. the jeer ol Cicero against Emcius in Pro
Rosc. Am. §lo—‘si tibi fortuna non dedit ut patre certo nascerere?

ᾧ 71. a. necessitudine. ‘Necessitudo’ denotes any close bond of con·
nexion. Hence ‘necessarius’ for a relation either by blood or marriage,
or simply an intimate friend, asin ξ 74.

b. quorum plerique, ‘ but most of them!

c. officie exprobrantium. Cp. Ter. And. 43, where Sosia com-
plains to Simo that his taking up his kindnesses looks as if he thought
they had been forgotten-

‘nam istaec commemoratio
quasi exprobratio est inmemori benefici’

α’. meminisse debet, &c See the same sentiment expressed hy
Demosthenes De Cor. 5 269, Dindorf. Theophrastus sets it down es
one of the traits of the ὑπερήφανος to remember the benefits conferred by
himself.

§72 a. inferiores. Accusative governed by extollere. The way in
which they are to raise their inferiors appears from the words below-
‘qni hac opinione non modo verbis’ &c
b. Sunt enim quidam, qui . . . faciunt. The speaker here may
. be supposed to have definite persons in view, whom he could name if he
wished. Cp. Horace’s ‘sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere,’
where he is talking of riches, and by ‘est qui' means himself. ‘Sunt
qni saciant ' would he generic. v
c. oum . . . putent, ‘in thinking!
h 73. a. sustinere. Supply ‘possit’
b. nonenim neque, &c The ‘neque’ here only strengtheus the

‘non' Nobbe's text omits it: but it is probably due to an irregularity
ol construction. Cicero may originally have conceived the sentence
somewhat in this way-³ non enim neque tu possis omnis tuosad honores
